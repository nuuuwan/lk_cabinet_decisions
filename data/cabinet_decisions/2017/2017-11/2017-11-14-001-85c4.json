  "decision_details": "- In the face of rapid industrialization, many countries have focused their attention on the mitigation of the adverse effects caused to the human health and environment due to the increased use of chemical substances.  Sri Lanka is also a signatory to the Basel Convention, Stockholm Convention, Rotterdam Convention and the Minamata Convention adopted in this regard. \n\n\tTherefore, when encouraging industry related investments for the economic development of Sri Lanka, it is necessary for Sri Lanka to take measures to ensure that chemical substances are used securely without being harmful to the eco-system.
