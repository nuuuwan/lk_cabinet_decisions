  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Mass Media Training Institute established in 1982, with the financial and human resource contribution of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Germany, was initiated with the objective of training the technicians required for the Sri Lanka Television Broadcasting Service. The institute is presently conducting about 18 courses aimed at various professions in the field of Mass Media and around 450 students are engaged annually in the educational activities of the institute.   \n\nA proposal has been made to implement a 3 year plan to transform the Sri Lanka Mass Media Training Institute to be the National Institute which provides the required professional training in the field of Mass Media of the country.  Through this initiative, it is expected to upgrade the infrastructure facilities of the institute and also to extend the training programmes to the Northern and Eastern Provinces. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance and Mass Media, to secure the funds required for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
