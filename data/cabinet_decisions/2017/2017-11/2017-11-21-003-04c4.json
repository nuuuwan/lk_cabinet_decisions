  "decision_details": "- The factors directly impacting on the collective public consciousness of a country are its Arts and Culture, Education, Mass Media and the Religion. From among the above, the field of Arts and Culture is decisive in performing a pioneering role in regard to healing of the society. A group of internationally renowned artists and intellectuals have made an initiative to create a cultural renaissance in Sri Lanka by the formulation and implementation of a new Arts and Cultural policy. Through the creation of a Vision, understanding and changes in relation to arts and culture of the country, it will be possible to build a grounding necessary to form a citizen to be integrated within one another and the other communities culturally.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to establish a National Operational Unit for the cultural renewal, affiliated to the Presidential Secretariat, for effective coordination among other relevant institutions and to take the necessary future measures for this purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
