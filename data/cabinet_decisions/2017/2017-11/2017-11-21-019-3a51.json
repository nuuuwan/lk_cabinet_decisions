  "decision_details": "- Thriposha is a nutritious food supplement, distributed free of charge by the Ministry of  Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to the children with malnutrition, pregnant mothers with nutrition problems and lactating mothers. The main raw material used for the manufacturing of Thriposha is full cream milk powder and from the year 2014 to 2017 the milk powder required for the purpose has been supplied by the M/s. Milco (Private) Limited. Considering the contribution that could be made for the local diary farmers in uplifting their economic well-being by continuing to purchase milk from Milco, which is a Government owned company engaged in the production of local milk products and the advantage of purchasing milk directly without intermediaries, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to purchase 600 MT of full cream milk required to manufacture Thriposha for the year 2018, for a sum of Rs.486 million (excluding tax), was approved by the Cabinet.",
