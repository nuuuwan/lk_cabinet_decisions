  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet has granted approval for the National Land Use Policy prepared by a Committee of Experts under the Sustainable Land Management Project and to enact legislation for its implementation. The absence of a National Land Use Policy to be enforced by law, has been identified as one of the major causes for the occurrence of disasters such as floods and landslides in the country in the recent times.  \n\nAs such, the proposal made by Hon. Gayantha Karunathilaka, the Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare the required draft Bill, based on the said National Land Use Policy, was approved by the Cabinet.",
