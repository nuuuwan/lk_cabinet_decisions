  "decision_details": "- The accommodation of the buildings  presently, used for  the High Courts, District Courts and Magistrate's Courts in the Hulftsdorp Court Complex, Colombo is limited and an element of risk has cropped up due to the buildings being very old.  Further, adequate building facilities need to be provided for the different institutions related to the justice sector, located in the Superior Courts Complex. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorala, the Minister of Justice, to select a suitable developer/contractor from among the local and foreign contractors who are presently engaged in the implementation of development projects in the country on competitive basis, to implement the 'House of Justice' project for the construction of a Courts complex comprising of 40 Court Houses, Ministry of Justice complex, upgrading the Judges' Institute and a Law Centre for training of Attorneys-at-Law, was approved by the cabinet.",
