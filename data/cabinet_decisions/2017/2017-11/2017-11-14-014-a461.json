  "decision_details": "- In generating electricity at the coal power plant in Puttalam, with a capacity of 900 MW, it burns about 2.4 Million Metric Tons of coal  per year. As a by product of the said burning process, it generates 255,000 MT of Ash per year and since Ash is used for manufacturing cement and roofing sheets, there is a high demand for Ash in the market. \n\nAs such, bids have been called for the disposal of Ash accumulated in the said power plant, under the Government Tender Procedure. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to dispose the quantum of Ash in the power plant to the qualified companies from among those who have submitted bids, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and the Procurement Appeal Board, was approved by the Cabinet.",
