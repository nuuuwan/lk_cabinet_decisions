  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet has granted approval previously for widening the Mahaiyawa tunnel, expanding the Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha, making improvements to the Old Kotte Road (Rajagiriya Section) and constructing the drainage system in the Kurunegala City by using the available savings of the road projects carried out under the Programme for the Rehabilitation of National Highways funded by the local banks.  \n\nSince acceleration of the improvements to the Old Kotte Road (Rajagiriya Section) will ease the existing traffic congestion around the Rajagiriya roundabout, it has become necessary to complete the improvements to that section within a short period of time and as such, the proposal made by Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, for the Road Development Authority to complete the task by adopting the direct labour method, was approved by the Cabinet.",
