  "decision_details": "- The Government has given priority to develop the dairy industry with a view to   enhancing the milk production in Sri Lanka.  Under this project with the objective of establishing large scale and medium scale commercial dairy farms, a project for the importation of 20,000 Heifers will be implemented and the first herd of Heifers is scheduled to reach the country on the 2017\u201105\u201117. The imported high breed Heifers will be provided at a subsidized rate to the farmers who conduct dairy farms on a commercial level and provide the funds for the purpose through a subsidized loan scheme. The Department of Animal Production and Health is expected to provide training for the beneficiaries with regard to the establishment of modern farms and their operational activities and  assistance of veterinary surgeons.  Presently, the beneficiary farmers have  already been selected for the 1st Phase and the infrastructure facilities of the farms concerned are being developed.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to implement the project under the proposed methodology with the objective of generating employment for at least   two Samurdhi beneficiaries  at a beneficiary farm with a minimum of at least 10 Heifers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
