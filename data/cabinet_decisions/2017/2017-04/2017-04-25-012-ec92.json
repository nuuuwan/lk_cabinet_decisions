  "decision_details": "- The Government is making plans to set up an industrial zone under the Hambantota port development project and it is anticipated that the demand for water supply will be increased significantly within the next 05 to 20 years time.  Since the water supply infrastructure facilities available in the area, at present, are not adequate to meet the  increasing demand for water, it is necessary to carry out a feasibility study expeditiously to prepare a suitable plan for providing facilities for Water Supply and Sewerage. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply to obtain the technical and financial assistance of M/s China Heavy Machinery Corporation  and follow the Swiss Challenge Procurement Procedure for the implementation of the project based on the results of the feasibility study, was approved by the Cabinet.",
