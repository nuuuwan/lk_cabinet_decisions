  "decision_details": "- Presently, 88 Elephants are kept in the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage within a total extent of 30 acres and it has been a difficult task to maintain these animals in such a restricted land area. As such, it has been proposed to give out a certain number out of these animals to persons or religious institutions with the necessary basic requirements. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, to give out to persons and institutions with the necessary basic requirements, selected by a Committee appointed by the Cabinet subject to specific conditions and also to issue Orders incorporating the necessary provision, was approved by the Cabinet. \n\nThe Cabinet also granted approved to provide tamed elephants for religious processions from a pool of elephants managed under the National Zoological Department and to issue Orders to regularize the registration of tamed elephants  and to provide them with protection.",
