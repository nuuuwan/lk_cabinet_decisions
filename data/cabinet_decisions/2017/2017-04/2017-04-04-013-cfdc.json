  "decision_details": "- Trilingual Sign Boards and Direction Boards are of paramount importance in maintaining an office environment that ensures the convenience of citizens seeking services from Public Institutions to reach the desired place without inquiring from any other officer. In accordance with the  Official Languages Policy, from the Main Name Board up to the Direction Boards,  Sign Boards of the Divisions, the Officers' Name Boards etc. should be trilingual and the  Reception Counter is expected to provide bi\u2011lingual services.  Although, action has been taken to set apart the required provision for the purpose, to Ministries, Departments and other Public Institutions under a separate Object Code, it is observed that the policy is not properly implemented in certain instances. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mano Ganeshan, the Minister of National Co\u2011existence, Dialogue and Official Languages to provide, any Public Institution which has not prepared the relevant Sign Boards in accordance with the Official Languages Policy, guidance to rectify same to be in compliance with the Official Languages Policy and if necessary, to provide additional provision for such purposes from the provision set apart for the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
