  "decision_details": "- In the Matugama Educational Zone of the Kalutara District  there are 18 estate and other schools which provide Tamil Medium education. These schools are primary schools that conduct classes only from Grade 1 to 5. As such, there are no Tamil Medium schools in the Zone, suitable for the students to seek education for the Advanced Level standards and therefore, the Tamil Medium students have to often attend the schools either in the Kalutara or Horana Educational Zones. As for the students who follow the Advanced Lelvel Classes in Science and Maths subjects, they have to invariably attend to schools situated in the Beruwela or Darga town educational zones.  \n\n\nTherefore, it has been identified that it is essential to commence a secondary school in the Tamil Medium in close proximity with the Matugama town. \n\nAccordingly, taking into consideration the joint proposal made by Hon. Mano Ganeshan, the Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages and Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, the Cabinet granted approval for the establishment of a Tamil Medium Secondary School in close proximity with the Matugama town with the corporation of the Ministry of Education and the Western Provincial Ministry of Education and to set apart a land in extent of about 05 acres for the purpose, from the Matugama Estate managed by the Namunukula Estate Company.",
