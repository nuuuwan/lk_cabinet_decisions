  "decision_details": "- The Batticaloa Teaching Hospital  is one of the premier hospitals in the Eastern Province and it provides tertiary health care  not only for the people of the Batticaloa District but also for the people from the adjacent Districts namely Ampara and Trincomalee. Due to the non\u2011availability of a Cardiology unit at the hospital the patients have to be transferred to far away hospitals for advanced Cardio vascular treatment and as such it has been identified that it is essential to construct a Cardiology unit for the hospital. National Competitive Bids have been invited to select a suitable contractor for the construction of this unit and in response 13 bidders have presented their bids. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to award the relevant contract to M/s Ancheneye Constructions (Pvt.) Ltd., the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder in accordance with the recommendations of the Technical Evaluation Committee which evaluated the bids and the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
