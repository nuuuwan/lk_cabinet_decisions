  "decision_details": "- With the result of the growth of the ability to gain access to digitization and the internet connectivity, a great impact has been made on the lives of the people and specially on ways in which the people are engaged such as in work, travel, learning activities, socialization and entertainment. At the same time, as the digital economy has permeated every aspect of the modern economy and as a result of which, progress has been achieved in the fields pertaining to rapid expansion of the market beyond the domestic borders, initiation of innovative methods in regard to business enterprises, provision of the strength needed for the scientific breakthroughs, generating of new employment opportunities and enhancement of labour productivity and economic development. \n\n\tEven though, Sri Lanka has made a significant progress in the promotion of digital infrastructure facilities, the achievement has not been adequate to meet the goal in transforming Sri Lanka into a digital economy. As such, through  the penetration of the digital economy of Sri Lanka, the need for a clear strategy for empowering every one  to reap its benefits has arisen. Accordingly,  the joint proposal made by Hon. Harin Fernando, the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure; and Hon. Malik Samarawickrema, the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade for the preparation of appropriate strategies for the digitization of the economy and to take appropriate measures for the implementation  of the proposed projects by the Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure and the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, was approved by the Cabinet.",
