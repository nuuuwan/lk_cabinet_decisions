  "decision_details": "- Public criticisms have been leveled against the malpractices that occur due to the monopoly that exist in conducting the practical tests for issuing Driving Licenses and it has been pointed out that this situation acts as a barrier to producing disciplined drivers. When considering the road accidents that presently occur the negligence of the drivers and their lack of knowledge of the road rules further justifies the above mentioned situation. \n\nAs a solution to this state of affairs, a proposal has been made to identify  suitable parties to conduct these practice tests in addition to the Examiners of Motor Vehicles of the Department of Motor Traffic. Through this process, it is anticipated to conduct the practical tests in a more qualitative manner and through proper regulation to exert accountability. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to appoint an Officials' Committee comprising of the representatives of the relevant institutions to obtain a Report with recommendations for a suitable methodology to be adopted in this process, after a study, was approved by the Cabinet.",
