  "decision_details": "- The Government continues to implement the annual programme for provision of footwear to the students studying in the difficult, most difficult and the isolated schools.  The procedure adopted at present in respect of the process, takes a considerable amount of time and also is faced with the practical difficulties with regard to the size of the footwear to match that of the measurement of the students.   As such, with a view to providing quality footwear for the students without delay, and as well as enhancing the competition among the producers, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to issue a cash voucher to the students when the programme for provision of footwear to the students for the year 2017 is implemented, was approved by the Cabinet.",
