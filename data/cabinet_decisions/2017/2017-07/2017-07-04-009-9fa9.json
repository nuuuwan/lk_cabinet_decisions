  "decision_details": "- Sheep Farming is mainly confined to the National Livestock Development Board Farms and a few private farms in the Northern and North Western Provinces.  The present stock of breedable animals are not up to the standard level as they have undergone inbreeding for many years and as such, the need for high quality breedable sheep has arisen since, after the first half of the 1980's introduction of new genes to the existing herds have not been made in Sri Lanka.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to import 25 breedable male sheep and 100 breedable female sheep for breeding, following the formal procurement procedure and to utilize Rs.10 million set apart for the purpose from the 2017 budgetary provision, was approved by the Cabinet.",
