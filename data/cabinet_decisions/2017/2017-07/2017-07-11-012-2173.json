  "decision_details": "- The Herbal Farmer Village Project which started in the year 2004 with the objective of producing the raw materials required in the production of Indigenous Medicine, instead of importing them, has been converted into the Herbal Farmer Company Ltd. in the year 2007.  The company is operated to purchase Indigenous Medical products, elevate the status of the herbal farmers, and to supply raw materials for the production of indigenous medicine. Even though, proposals were called for from investors for a joint venture under  a Public-Private Partnership collaboration so that it will not create a financial  burden to the Government, no suitable investor has responded in this connection.  \n\n\tAs such, with a view to promoting the living standard of the indigenous herbal farmers and providing a significant contribution to the national economy through the production of medicinal plants, the Cabinet granted approval to vest the assets and the resources of the company to the Ministry of Primary Industries for the further continuation of the activities of the company.",
