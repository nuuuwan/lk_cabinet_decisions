  "decision_details": "- As a result of adopting a staggered system for Provincial Councils Elections during the past, instead of adopting the methodology which prevailed in conducting of the Provincial Council Elections in all Provinces on the same day, an undesirable environment has emerged in the country resulting in a large wastage of  resources such as financial, human and other resources, undue disruption to the State service Delivery System and day to day activities of the general public and the increase of election related violence, malpractices and the abuse of state property. Taking these matters into consideration, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister to amend the relevant provisions contained in the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988 to enable to hold all the Provincial Council Elections in all the Provinces on the same day, was approved by the Cabinet.",
