Presently, the religious and school buildings are more commonly used as temporary safety centres and due to the inadequacy of facilities available in them and as the use of school buildings adversely, it affects the school children in their educational activities a proposal has been made to construct common safety centres at district level to be used in any disaster situation. \n\nAccordingly, taking into consideration, a proposal made by Hon.
