  "decision_details": "- The daily collection of Solid Waste within the limits of the Chillaw Urban Council is around 18 to 20 Mt while within the limits of the Pradeshiya Sabha of Chillaw and Arachchikattuwa the Solid Waste collection daily amounts to around 06 to 05 Mt, respectively. These Solid Waste is disposed of in sites which are not scientifically developed for such dumping and as a result, environmental and societal issues have cropped up. As such, an integrated Waste Management Project has been planned to be implemented by these three (03)  Local Government Institutions for the management of the non\u2011degradable waste collected within their limits. \n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, to vest a plot of land in extent of 05 acres out of the land called Manaweriyawatta, situated in the Karukkuliya Grama Niladhari Division within the Divisional Secretary's Division of Arachchikattuwa  belonging to the Land Reform Commission and presently possessed by the National Livestock Development Board, with the Chillaw Urban Council on a 30 year lease basis in order to implement the project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
