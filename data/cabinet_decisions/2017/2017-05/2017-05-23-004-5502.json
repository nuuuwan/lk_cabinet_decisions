  "decision_details": "- Taking into consideration the various reforms undertaken by the peer countries in their investment climates to move investments to a higher level, Sri Lanka also should adopt reforms required to promote the flow of Investment into the Country by which the competitiveness of Sri Lanka in regard to investment could be moved up the rankings. As such, the necessity to introduce appropriate reforms has been identified to resolve issues relating to the coordination and collaboration in different Line Ministries and Agencies and activate appropriate mechanisms with detailed implementation plans to devolve  accountability and leadership. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, to establish a Secretariat in the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, with a group dedicated entirely for the purpose, to establish 10 Technical  Task Forces for coordination with the relevant institutions and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation required for the proposed legal reforms, was approved by the Cabinet.",
