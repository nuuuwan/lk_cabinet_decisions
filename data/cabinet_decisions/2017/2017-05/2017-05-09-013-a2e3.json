  "decision_details": "- Around 120 Medical Specialists and 570 Medical Officers are serving in the Teaching Hospital, Karapitiya and the inadequacy of official residences for them has become a serious problem. Since about 15 of the existing quarters of the Medical Officers have to be removed for the proposed development activities of the hospital immediately, an expeditious programme has also to be implemented in that regard. Considering these facts, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to purchase 10 houses from the Vekunagoda 'Nila Sewana' Housing Scheme in Galle for the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital at a cost of Rs.38.7 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
