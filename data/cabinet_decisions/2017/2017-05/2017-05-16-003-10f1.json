In this respect, developing a regional level tourism destination and improving the infrastructure facilities related to it, is of great importance.  Kalpitiya area which is endowed with a unique eco-system and a striking sea frontage with diversity marine resources with multiple tourists attractions has become popular among domestic as well as foreign tourists and the area has a vast potential for tourism development. However, the hotels and  other tourism facilities available in the area is inadequate to fulfill the desires of high end tourists. As such, the proposal made by Hon.
