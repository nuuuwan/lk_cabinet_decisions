  "decision_details": "- The present water flow of the Heda Oya which is the main water supply source for the supply of safe drinking water for the people residing in Lahugala, Pottuvil, Paanama and Siyambalanduwa and for the tourist zones of Pottuvil and Paanama, is not adequate to meet the demand for drinking water. The Cabinet has already granted approval for the implementation of a project to  construct a reservoir by building a dam across the Heda Oya and the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, to select a suitable contractor following the 'Swiss Challenge' procurement procedure to implement the Heda Oya Water Supply Project, concurrently with that project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
