  "decision_details": "- The Genito-Urinary Surgery Unit was established at the National Hospital in Sri Lanka in the year 1955 and provides treatment for a variety of surgical conditions including urinary stones, diseases of the prostrate glands, Genito-Urinary cancers, female urethra problems and over fifty other surgical diseases. Prior to the establishment of the kidney transplantation unit at Maligawatta, this unit was engaged in the kidney transplantation as well. Presently, this unit is functioning in a dilapidated building which could no longer be renovated and as such, it should be relocated expeditiously in another building with the necessary facilities. For this purpose, Ms. E.A.M. Maliban Textiles (Pvt.) Ltd. has expressed its willingness to demolish the present building and construct a new three story building at an estimated cost of a sum of Rs.150 million. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding between the sponsor  institution and the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine  to  construct a state of the art building inclusive of an Intensive Care unit with a capacity for 80 - 100 beds, was approved by the Cabinet.",
