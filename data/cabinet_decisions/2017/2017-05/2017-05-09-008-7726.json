  "decision_details": "- In accordance with the provision of section 45 of the Judicature Act, No.2 of 1978, the Hon. Minister in charge of the subject of Justice is vested with the authority of appointing Justices of the Peace in any particular zone, district or division of the country. Accordingly, Justices of the Peace are appointed to serve in any particular judicial zone, district or division considering their places of residence to enable them to provide their services with ease. However, the Justices of the Peace have brought to the notice of the Ministry of Justice that due to judicial zones being changed from time to time, it is practically difficult for them to identify their respective judicial zones. \n\n\tTaking these facts into consideration, it has been found that the appointment of Justices of the Peace for administrative districts would be more practicable instead of appointing Justices of the Peace to any particular judicial zone or division. As such, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Justice to instruct the Legal Draftsman to amend section 45 of the  Judicature Act, No.2 of 1978, with a view to providing such legislation as required, was approved by the Cabinet.",
