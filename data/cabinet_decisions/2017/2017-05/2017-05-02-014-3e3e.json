  "decision_details": "- There are 08 Regional Centres of the Ocean University of Sri Lanka located at Mattakkuliya, Kalutara, Galle, Tangalle, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Jaffna and Negambo and these Centres conduct Diploma Courses and Higher Diploma Courses at National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) Level 5 and 6 which have a great demand in the fishing and the marine fields. Presently, there is also a high demand for skilled man power in the fields of marine communication, diving, under water welding and boat building. However, there is no possibility of expanding the capacity of the training centre conducted at Dediyawala in Kalutara district any further, and as such, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, to construct a new Regional Training Centre of the Ocean University in a plot of land belonging to the Ministry of  Skills Development and Vocational Training in the Grama Niladhari Division of Uyankale situated in the Divisional Secretariat Division of Panadura and to provide the equipment and infrastructure facilities necessary for the Centre, was approved by the Cabinet.",
