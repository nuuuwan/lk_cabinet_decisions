  "decision_details": "- A large number of Government Institutions are established within the Colombo District and since a considerable number of officers serving in these institutions are residents living outside the Colombo District, they expect official residences for them. Even though, some number of residences owned by the  Ministry of Public Administration and Management have been provided for the executive grade of the public service and other officers due to exigencies of service, providing residences for officers like the Secretaries to Ministries and Heads of Departments has paused a problem due to the dearth of such official residences. As a solution to the problem a project has been planned to construct a 08 story building to house 49 official residences in a portion of land in extent of 0.2840 hectares belonging to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management located at Hector Kobbekaduwa Mawatha, Colombo 07 where the office of the  Land Reform Commission was established previously and the project is due to commence this year and complete by the end of 2019. As such the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the Minister of Public Administration and Management, to implement the relevant project and to obtain the funds necessary for the purpose from the General Treasury within the period of 2017 - 2019, was approved by the Cabinet.",
