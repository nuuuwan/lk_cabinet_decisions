Considering the social, economic, environmental, climatic and institutional changes that had taken place during the past a necessity has now arisen to address the present and future eventualities by enacting a new Flood Management Act incorporating provision to minimize the damages which my be caused to lives, property, environment and the economy from the adverse effects of flood disasters caused by rivers and reservoirs and as well as urban and local storm waters and various other causes.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.
