  "decision_details": "- \tThe Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) situated in Malabe, initiated under a fund provided by the Mahapola Trust Fund, by now, is a leading educational institute which awards degrees in technological, business and engineering fields. Presently, there are nearly 7,000 students engaged in   educational activities and the institute, over the past, has produced about 9,000 graduates.  The institute needs to be further developed by attracting investors, and getting affiliated with foreign higher educational institutes. Considering the fact that the loan obtained from the Mahapola Trust Fund has been completely settled, the proposal made by H.E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena, to make provision required for the institute to continue as an Independent Degree Awarding Higher Educational Institute in the future, was approved by the Cabinet.",
