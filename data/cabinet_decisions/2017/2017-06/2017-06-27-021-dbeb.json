  "decision_details": "- The Government has made initiatives to upgrade the Kalutara General Hospital as a premier hospital in the Western Province. As such, as a solution to the lack of space in the existing building for administrative functions, it has been proposed to commence the construction work of the Phase II of the building.   National competitive bids have been invited to select a suitable contractor for the purpose and in response 5 bidders have presented their bids.       \n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to award the contract to the State Engineering Corporation,  the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder as per the recommendations of the Technical Evaluation Committee which evaluated the bids and the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
