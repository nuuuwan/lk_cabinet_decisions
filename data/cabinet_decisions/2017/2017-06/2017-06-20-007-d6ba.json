  "decision_details": "- Presently, 13 public sector vocational training centres function in the Trincomalee District conducting 54 training courses in diverse fields while around 24 training courses are conducted in the vocational training centres operated by the private sector. Approximately, 2,200 students have undergone training at these public sector training centres. At present, these training centres provide only the vocational training courses of NVQ level 3 and 4 and therefore, to follow the training courses of NVQ level 5 and 6 the students have to attend the University Colleges in either Anuradhapura or Jaffna. Under these circumstances, it has been found that the establishment of a University College in the Trincomalee District is an absolute need. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, to establish a University College at Kinya in the Trincomalee District at a cost of Rs.434 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
