  "decision_details": "- Land is a limited resource and as such, it has to be utilized with frugality and fruitfully. Due to the various limitations prohibiting the use of paddy lands for purposes other than agriculture, the development of human settlements especially in the areas subject to rapid urbanization has caused much concern. As such, the need has arisen for the use of abandoned and barren paddy lands as compatible with the town development plans and without giving way for the emergence of environmental problems for human settlements.  \n\n\tTaking note of the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction in this respect, the Cabinet decided to appoint a Committee comprising of the representatives of the relevant Ministries and other Government Institutions to decide on the methodology to be adopted with regard to the under utilized portions of lands and abandoned and barren paddy lands when such lands are given over for construction activities while also retaining the formal safety measures pertaining to environmental protection.",
