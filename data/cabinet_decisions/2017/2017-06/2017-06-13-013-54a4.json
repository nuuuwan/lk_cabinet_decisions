  "decision_details": "- The model and reawakened village development programme launched by the Ministry of Housing and Construction is implemented successfully in all Districts of Sri Lanka and when providing houses under this programme special attention is focused on families affected by the  Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology. However, problems have cropped up due to the absence of safe drinking water and the inadequacy of the available water supply programmes in certain areas  where this programme is implemented. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction to provide drinking water necessary to the housing projects implemented in the 11 Districts affected by the CKDUE expeditiously, with the coordination of the National Community Water Supply Department and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, was approved by the Cabinet.",
