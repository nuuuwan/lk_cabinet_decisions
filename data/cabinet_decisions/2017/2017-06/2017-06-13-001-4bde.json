  "decision_details": "- The three storey building constructed by the Sri Lanka Navy with a provision of Rs.215 million allocated by the Ministry of Education for the Defence Services Viru Daru Vidupiyasa, Kurunegala, was declared open for the students  in the month of March. However, as the building does not provide other essential facilities for educational as well as extra curricular activities, such as science labs, libraries, an auditorium, computer labs, etc. the proposal made by H.E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence to construct a three storey building equipped with general facilities so as to avert such shortcomings, was approved by the Cabinet.",
