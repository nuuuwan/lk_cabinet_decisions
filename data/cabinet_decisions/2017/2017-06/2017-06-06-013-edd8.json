  "decision_details": "- As a result of the torrential rains that fell on certain areas of the Island during the 25th and 26th of May, 2017, lives were lost and damages were caused to several properties due to the floods and landslides. Waste and garbage have been accumulated in large quantities in the disaster affected areas and the health sectors have pointed out the importance of disposing of such waste expeditiously.  As the vehicles and equipment belonging to the institutions of the Provincial Councils are inadequate to dispose of the huge quantities of such accumulated garbage, the joint proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, the Minister of Disaster Management and Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government to provide an additional provision in a sum of Rs.100 million for the purchase of the vehicles and the equipment necessary for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
