  "decision_details": "- The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka has established an Industrial Township in the Perth Estate of Horana in a total extent of 1,463 acres of land and in the  3 Industrial Zones implemented therein, there are 20 commercial industries in operation generating 2,500 employment opportunities. In addition to these 3 industrial zones, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka has given approval to implement a number of other projects within this industrial township. The Horana export processing zone has to be provided with an adequate supply of water but due to technical reasons it has not been possible to augment beyond the 2,500 cubic meters of water supply provided at present to the zone per day. As such, the Board of Investment has prepared a plan to have a water supply scheme for a capacity of 8,000 cubic meters per day for this industrial zone and accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Malik Samarawickrema, the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade,  to vest the land in extent of 2 Acres 00 Roods and 5.1 Perches selected for the implementation of the water supply scheme situated at Maguruwela area in Horana with the Board of Investment, was approved by the Cabinet.",
