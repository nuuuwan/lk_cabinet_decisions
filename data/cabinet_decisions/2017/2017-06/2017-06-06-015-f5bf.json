  "decision_details": "- The Buddhist Vihara established, presently, in New Delhi is governed by the Mahabodhi Society and the temple is located within a limited space. A Buddhist Stupa or adequate facilities are not found there for the pilgrims who arrive in New Delhi from Sri Lanka and other Buddhist countries.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Foreign Affairs to conduct discussions with the relevant authorities of the Government of India to an adequate block of land to construct a Buddhist Stupa in New Delhi, was approved by the Cabinet.",
