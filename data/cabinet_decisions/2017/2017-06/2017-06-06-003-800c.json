  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that the predominant health problem faced by Sri Lanka is in regard to non-communicable diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetics, cancer etc. Recent findings show that in Sri Lanka the non\u2011communicable diseases account for 59% of the total deaths and the most of those who succumbed are below the age of 60 years. Since there is a trend for obesity even among the adolescents due to not being engaged in physical exercises, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to implement a new programme with the recommendations of the Ministry of Education which would pave the way to encourage the school children to be engaged in physical activities more and more during the school hours, and for them to have more facilities to get the food items which are conducive  to their health, was approved by the Cabinet.",
