  "decision_details": "- Even though, the Department of Agriculture and several Institutions of the private sector are engaged in seed production activities, these institutions have failed to supply the total demand for the improved seed varieties adaptable to the climatic conditions of the country and as such, the demand is met with a large quantity of imported seeds. As a solution to the problem, it has been planned to implement an integrated project at the Mahailuppallama Field Crops Research and Development Centre with the Lal Teer Seed Ltd. of Bangaladesh which produces high quality seeds and which has the potential for research and development. The funds necessary for the project will be provided for by the Company and the Department of Agriculture will supply the land needed for the purpose. The technical know-how and the genetic resources available with the two parties will be utilized  in this process. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture to sign the relevant Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to implement the proposed integrated project  and to empower the Director General of Agriculture to sign the MoU  was approved by the Cabinet.",
