  "decision_details": "- Around 90% of the population of Sri Lanka has the facilities for having safe drinking water and out of which 46% fulfill their needs through pipe borne supplies. The National Water Supply & Drainage Board undertakes the supply of 35% of the pipe borne water and the balance of 11% is covered by the community based water projects. Taking into consideration, the necessity of state intervention for the regulation and settlement of issues which had arisen as a result of these projects implemented by the community, the Department of National Community Water Supply was established in 2014.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply to register the community projects which supply water for the rural community under the department and to establish 'community based co\u2011ordinating units' at Divisional and District level for the regulation of such community based organizations, was approved by the Cabinet. The Cabinet also noted the submissions made by the Minister that an awareness programme has been organized from 20th to 23rd of June, 2017 for the representatives of the  community based organizations and the public officers, in this regard.",
