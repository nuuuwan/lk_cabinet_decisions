  "decision_details": "- The National Building Research Organization has found that the number of families residing in landslide high risk areas stands at 14,680 in Nine Districts. As there is a risk of these families being subject to disaster during the periods of  heavy rain, the need has arisen for evacuating them expeditiously from the lands they reside and settling them in other suitable places. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, the Minister of Disaster Management, to provide such families with Government financial assistance for them to purchase a land and a house from a safe place, to examine the possibility of giving them houses from the housing projects implemented by the the Ministry of Housing and Construction and to take appropriate measures to prevent the families from settling down in high risk zones once again, was approved by the Cabinet.",
