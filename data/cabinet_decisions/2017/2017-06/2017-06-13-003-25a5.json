  "decision_details": "- The Ozone layer acts as a shield preventing the harmful ultra violet rays falling on the earth and ensure protection of all living beings and plants. The global community having considered the urgent necessity of regulating and the gradual phasing out of the use of the chemical substances that damage the Ozone Layer, established the Vienna Convention and subsequently, the Montreal Protocol in 1987.  The last amendment to the Montreal Protocol was carried out on 15th October, 2015 in Kigali, Rwanda and at this Convention all parties expressed their willingness over the gradual phasing out of Hydroflurocarbons - HFC.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, for Sri Lanka to appoint a Committee to plan out the activities for the ratification of the amendment expeditiously and thereafter, to ratify the amendment by Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
