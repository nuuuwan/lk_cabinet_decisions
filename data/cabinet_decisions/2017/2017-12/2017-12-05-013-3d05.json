  "decision_details": "- In the decade of 1980, the Myliddy fishery harbour situated in the Walikkamam area of Jaffna was a major fishery harbour which provided a significant contribution towards the fishery industry and it was considered unique due to the fact that it could be used even during the North East monsoon period. During the period of the conflict, the activities of this harbour was disrupted and with the re-emergence of a peaceful environment in the Northern Province, the fisheries  harbour and its 54 acre land has been released in July 2017 enabling it to be used for the fisheries industry. \n\n\tSince, the displaced people who were living in the area have returned to the area once again, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs,  to take measures to commence the renovation activities expeditiously in the Myliddy fishery harbour, was approved by the Cabinet.",
