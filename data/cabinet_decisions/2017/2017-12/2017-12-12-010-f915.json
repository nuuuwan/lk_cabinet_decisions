  "decision_details": "- The institute of technology KYUTECH, one of the National Universities of Japan, has implemented a programme, with the aim of granting capability of basic satellite technologies acquisition for the countries which have not  undertaken space faring. Thereby it provides experiences on the whole process of planning, designing, developing, fabricating, examining, launching and operating a Nano-Satellite. Under its first stage, a Satellite has been successfully launched to the orbit by a team of engineers representing the countries of Japan, Mongolia,Ghana and Bangladesh.\n\n\nTwo Engineers of the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies (ACCIMT) have been selected for designing a  Nano-Satellite and launching it under the next stage of this programme and thereby it would be able for Sri Lanka to obtain knowledge and experiences of this field. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Science, Technology and Research, to enter into a Cooperative Research Agreement with the Japanese National University - Kyushu Institute of Technology (KYUTECH), Japan and the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies (ACCIMT) on the participation in the Nano-Satellite programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
