  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau has planned to implement a Digital Advertising Campaign to promote Sri Lanka as a favourite travel destination in the countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India and China. Due to various reasons, the selection of a suitable Agency for the purpose has been delayed and  the need to expedite the process has been identified.\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. John Amaratunga, the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, to call for bids for the purpose from the Digital Advertising Agencies as recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM), was approved by the Cabinet.",
