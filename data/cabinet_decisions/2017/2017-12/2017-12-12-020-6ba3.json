  "decision_details": "- It has been planned to construct a Housing Complex in the Kundasale area in Kandy under the 'Nilasevana' Housing Project implemented as a Public-Private Partnership Project, with a view to providing houses to Public Officers. Since the land allocated for the purpose is situated adjacent to the Meditation Centre, it has been decided to implement the project in another location, taking into consideration the hindrances that could be caused to the activities taking place at this religious site.\n\nAs such, the joint proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Maddumabandara, the Minister of Public Administration and Management and Hon. Malik Samarawickrema, the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, to allocate a block of land situated in the Mahawatta village in the Kundasale area as an alternative land, was approved by the Cabinet.",
