  "decision_details": "- There are 49,654 hectares of land under the custody of the State Plantation Companies and the direct employment opportunities provided by the companies are 16,373. The weak financial position, excessive of statutory obligations, outdated agricultural practices, inefficient management practices and different external factors have resulted in long term under-performance of these plantation companies.\n\nTherefore, a proposal has been made to implement a performance enhancing process of these plantation companies through the introduction of modern technology and crop varieties, optimum utilization of land and natural resources, access for private investments, institutional development and providing solutions for difficulties faced by those who are engaged in the plantation sector. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Kabir Hashim, the Minister of Public Enterprise Development, to implement the proposed project in respect of the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB), Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation (SLSPC), Elkaduwa Plantations Limited (EPL), Gal-Oya Plantations and the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation (SLCC), was approved by the Cabinet.",
