  "decision_details": "- Twenty five Divisional Offices have been established at the level of Administrative Districts to facilitate in carrying out the statutory as well as the administrative functions of the Election Commission. Since the Jaffna Election Office functions within a limited space set apart from the Jaffna District Secretariat building with inadequate facilities, the need for the construction of a separate office building for same has been identified and for this purpose, a plot of land belonging to the Government within the municipal limits of Jaffna has already been allocated.\n\n\tAccordingly, taking into consideration the present and future needs,              the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to construct a  4 storey building with a floor area of 18,425 sq.ft. for the Election Office of the Jaffna District and to secure funds amounting to Rs.97.7 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
