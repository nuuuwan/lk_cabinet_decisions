  "decision_details": "- Due to the non-production of the required quantity of liquid milk or milk powder inside the country for the consumption of the Sri Lankans, a large amount of foreign currency has to be disbursed annually for the importation of such dairy products. Therefore, focus of the Government has been made for enlisting the contribution of the Youth Community to enhance the dairy production capacity in the country adopting advanced scientific methods and technology.\n\n\tAs such, a proposal has been made to implement a programme for producing of Young Dairy Farm Entrepreneurs under the aegis of the National Programme on Food Production. Under this programme, it has been planned to select youth to be fully involved in dairy farming, provide them with technical knowledge and resources and, to build them up as entrepreneurs with the capacity of producing at least 100 litres of milk, per day. It is expected that it would be possible to raise the domestic dairy production to the optimal level, by establishing such 10,000 units of young entrepreneurs.\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to implement its Pilot Project in the District of Kandy with the assistance of the Ministry of Rural Economy, the Central Provincial Council and the District Secretariat, Kandy and to implement the same in other areas based on its success, was approved by the Cabinet.",
