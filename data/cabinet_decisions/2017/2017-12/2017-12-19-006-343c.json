  "decision_details": "- Since, the 'Channel EYE' launched as the second channel of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and operated from the year 2000 prioritizes its air time for sports programmes, the necessity of an exclusive channel has arisen specially for the Tamil speaking people of the Northern and the Eastern Provinces. When promoting National Reconciliation since, the existence of a TV channel of this nature is a prerequisite, it has been decided to establish a new channel named the 'Reconciliation Channel' and a separate frequency has also been allocated. Orders have been placed by now to procure the required technological equipment for the new channel and a studio complex has to be constructed in the Northern Province for its broadcasting activities.\n\n\tAs such, a 100 perches of land in the Chavakachcheri area in Jaffna, where the Meesalei Weerasingham Central College is situated has been set apart by the District Secretary of Jaffna for the construction of the said studio complex.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance and Mass Media, to vest the said land with the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC), was approved by the Cabinet.",
