  "decision_details": "- With a view to providing a better service to the air passengers and tourists, two investors have been provided with blocks of land for the construction and maintenance of two hotels with Star Class in two blocks of land located in the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport, belonging to the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited (AASL). However, due to the failure of pursuing action by those investors in terms of their proposals, it has been decided to call for Requests for Proposals (RFP) once again, in respect of those blocks of land. \n\n\tAs such, proposals have already been called upon for the construction of a 4-Star Airport hotel in one of the blocks of land and the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to call for proposals to select a suitable investor for the construction and maintenance of a 2-Star Airport Hotel in the other block of land, was approved by the Cabinet.",
