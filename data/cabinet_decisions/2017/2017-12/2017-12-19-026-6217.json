Management of the wild animal human conflict and related duties including the elephant-human conflict are also entrusted with the Wildlife Conservation Officers. Around 240 wild elephants die each year due to the elephant-human conflict. Meanwhile, several incidents of killing tuskers within the protected areas have been reported during the recent times. \n\n\tAs such, with a view to preventing the recurrence of such situations and to protect the country's elephant population including the tuskers and other wild animals within the precincts of the forests,  the proposal made by Hon.
