  "decision_details": "- As the two theaters of the Cardiology unit of the Colombo National Hospital, are under renovation, the heart surgeries performed there have been suspended. As such, the Colombo National Hospital is presently transferring the patients there over to the Sri Jayawardhanapura Hospital for heart surgeries, but it has not been an adequate measure to overcome the issue. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister and Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to make necessary arrangements to refer the heart patients over to the private hospitals where cardiology units are available, for emergency treatments, at Government expense and to expedite the renovation work of the Cardiology unit in the Colombo National Hospital, was approved by the Cabinet.",
