  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that the need for milk is more than 5,000 litre per day in Jaffana town and the surrounding areas. Consumption of liquid milk is also hiking up and therefore, in order to fulfill the need, it is imperative that the facilities be upgraded for the management of milk production.\n\nAs such, it has been planned to purchase machines to pasteurize milk and  hand over these machines to the YARLCO milk processing factory of the Jaffna District Development Cooperative Society so as to expand and strengthen the liquid milk and milk related production network in the Jaffana District. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, to implement the proposed project at an estimated cost of Rs. 59.8 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
