  "decision_details": "- The Port of Kankesanthurai located 15 km in North to the City of Jaffna was a Port constructed for the transportation of raw materials required for the Kankesanthurai Cement Factory. Cargo Vessels below 2,500 tons can be operated at this Port which is around 06 metres in depth. Since this Port is located in close proximity with Indian Harbours, there is a potential of connecting this with the international shipping activities, enhancing regional industries and developing the same as a Regional Harbour providing the services required for the Northern and North Central Provinces.\n\nAccordingly, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has designed plans for the rehabilitation of the breakwater of the Port of Kankesanthurai, construction of a new jetty in order to expand its commercial operations. It has been decided to establish a Warehouse and to construct an Administration Building. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to transfer a land in extent of 50 acres required for the purpose, from the Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, over to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, was approved by the Cabinet.",
