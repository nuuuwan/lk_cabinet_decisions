  "decision_details": "- Due to the difficulty in accessing the facilities such as health,  education, safety water and other infrastructure, the life indicators pertaining to the plantation region are low when compared to the other areas of the country. As such, it is essential to improve the road development activities for easy access to such infrastructure facilities. Accordingly,  the proposal made by Hon. U. Palani Digambaram, the Minister of  Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development, to rehabilitate the road section in the Hatton area leading from Brodack to Abbotsligh by mettalling and taring, was approved by the Cabinet.",
