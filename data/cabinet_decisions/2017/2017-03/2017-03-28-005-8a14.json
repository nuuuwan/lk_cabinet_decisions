  "decision_details": "- There is a popular trend in Sri Lanka for  electric motor cars.  The number of electronic cars which had been limited to 90 cars in 2014, has been increased up to around 4,000 by now. Around 50 Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) are being operated in the country, centered in the main towns. Although the Electric Vehicle Battery Charging Stations sell electricity, the provisions for regulation of this activity have not been incorporated in the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No. 20 of 2009. \n\n\n\n\tAccordingly, with a view to safeguarding the rights of the electric car users, concerning the matters of sales tariff, safety measures, accuracy of measuring devices, intervention to resolve consumer complaints and disputes, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to amend the Electricity Act No.20 of 2009 by incorporating the relevant provisions to address the above  and to pursue action on the guidance of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka, with regard to the affairs of the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations until such time the legislation is in place, was approved by the Cabinet.",
