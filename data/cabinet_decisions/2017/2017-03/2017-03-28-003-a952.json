E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to carryout  a formal feasibility study and on the results, to call for proposals  from local and international organizations following a transparent procedure for selecting a suitable organization to conduct scientific mining prior to filling the reservoir with water and to export the produce after value addition with the objective of getting a significant contribution to the National Economy, was approved by the Cabinet.",
