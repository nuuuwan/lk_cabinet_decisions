  "decision_details": "- The general public have to face various difficulties due to the problem of stray dogs and it has been found that there is no adequate legal provision in the Registration of Dogs Ordinance No. 25 of 1901 to address this issue.  Although the Cabinet approval has been granted to repeal both the Registration of Dogs Ordinance and the Rabies Ordinance and draft a new Bill, which would address all these issues, but the matter has not been completed up to date. Therefore, taking into consideration the immediate necessity for the solution of the problem of stray dogs, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government to instruct the Legal Draftsman to amend the Registration of Dogs Ordinance increasing the fine imposed on persons who abandon their dogs up to Rs.25,000/- and also increase the term of imprisonment up to two years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
