  "decision_details": "- The daily inflow of patients to the entire hospital system of Sri Lanka as well as the indoor patients is very high and various medical reports are necessary for  diagnosing the diseases of the patients. Among these, there are patients afflicted with various complex diseases who need constant diagnosis. For this purpose, it is essential to keep their records so as to be able to make references. Some of the reports are kept in the hospital while some are with the patients. Therefore, storing and conserving the data with the help of advanced technology to be referred to when such information is needed, is a timely need. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to implement a project for establishing a Picture Archival and Communication System and Radiology Information System network in 20 Government Hospitals, was approved by the Cabinet.",
