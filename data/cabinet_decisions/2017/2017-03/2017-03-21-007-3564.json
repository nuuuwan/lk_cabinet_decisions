  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka's  infrastructure development lags behind, in contrast to other competitor countries in the region, as a result of being dependent on public funding for infrastructure development projects. This situation has created enormous pressure on the Government fiscal operations. In this background, it is vitally important for the country to adopt successful PPP modalties operated in other countries. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister to appoint a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee and a Project Committee for the formulation of a suitable mechanism to attract foreign investment into the country through successful PPP modalties, was approved by the Cabinet.",
