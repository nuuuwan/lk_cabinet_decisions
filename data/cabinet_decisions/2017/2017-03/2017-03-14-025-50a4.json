  "decision_details": "- The water distribution network which facilitates pipe borne water for the people of Kalutara District is more than 70 years old and to minimize the leakages that occur as a result and also to fulfil the increasing demand of water facilities due to rapid urbanization, the improvement of the Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project is imperative. The Government of Japan has expressed its willingness to grant a sum of Japanese Yen 31,810 Million through the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) (approximately Rs.42,240 Million) for the implementation of the Kalu Ganga Water Supply Expansion Project.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe, the Prime Minister, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to enter into a loan Agreement with JICA, was approved by the Cabinet.",
