  "decision_details": "- Rs.2,000 million has been allocated to the Ministry of Rural Economy under the 2016 Budged Proposals for setting-up of cold stores with the main objective of stabilizing prices in the market and minimizing post harvest losses. Accordingly, on the results of a feasibility study made by a Committee comprising of State and Private Sector University Experts, it was decided that setting-up of two cold stores centered on the Dambulla and Keppetipola dedicated economic centers was most appropriate for which the Cabinet has already granted approval.   In order to commence the activities of the projects expeditiously to enable them to be completed by October 2017, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to award the consultancy contract to Design consultants as recommended by the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee for a sum of Rs.30.1 Million without VAT, was approved by the Cabinet.",
