  "decision_details": "- The assistance of trained construction machinery mechanics armed with knowledge and skill are essential to repair and maintain the construction machinery used to meet the growing needs of the large scale construction projects day by day. There is a high demand for such machinery mechanics in the local as well as foreign job markets and as such the   implementation of a programme of proper standard to train them has become an urgent need. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to conduct a full time 03 year training Course at NVQ 4 Level at the Construction Equipment Training Centre (CETRAC) functioning under the Ministry of Housing and Construction for the training of Construction Machinery Mechanics, was approved by the Cabinet.",
