  "decision_details": "- The number of students who drop out from schools after G.C.E. (O/L) and G.C.E.(A/L) annually, in the Gampaha District is approximately 17,500 but the maximum number of students who could be accommodated in the Vocational Training Centres existing in the District is around 7,300.  Out of these it is only a number of around 960 students who could be admitted to the Training Centres of the Vocational Training Authority. Taking into consideration the demand for the skilled craftsmen in the labour market, the establishment of a new Vocational Training Centre in the Gampaha District is a felt need.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, to establish a new Vocational Training Centre at Pahala Yagoda in Gampaha, was approved by the Cabinet.",
