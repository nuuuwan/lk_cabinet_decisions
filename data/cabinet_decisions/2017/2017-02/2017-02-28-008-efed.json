  "decision_details": "- In the month of May 2016, Sri Lanka had the heaviest recorded rainfall in more than 18 years which caused severe floods in 24 Districts and also the gravest landslide ever recorded along with a number of other landslides. It was reported that floods and landslides affected around 493,319 persons, caused 93 deaths and injured 33 and found 117 persons missing. In the aftermath of the disaster, the Ministry of Disaster Management had conducted a Post-Disaster Needs Assessment with the collaboration of the International Stakeholders and the relevant Ministries, the United Nations Organization, the World Bank and the European Union. The assessment had proposed a long term plan to strengthen the pre-preparedness and to minimize the risks liable to be caused due to disasters and climatic conditions.  Accordingly, based on the Post Disaster Management Report, the proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, the Minister of Disaster Management, for the implementation of an extensive action programme for disaster management in Sri Lanka, within the 5 year period from 2018 to 2023, was approved by the Cabinet.",
