  "decision_details": "- A German Company has come forward to implement an integrated project with the collaboration of several companies of Sri Lanka, which would provide solutions to address the high priority challenges, with regard to encouraging the use of organic fertilizer in place of chemical fertilizer in food production, preservation of fruits, waste management and renewable power generation, as a whole. Under this investment programme, it is expected to establish a Unit for the production of organic fertilizer associated with the solid waste management Yard of the Kandy Municipal Council.  The organic fertilizer produced in the first year is intended to be provided free of charge to the Lanka Fertilizer Company Ltd. It is anticipated to add about 6-10 MWs of renewable power to the National Grid and to minimize the quantity of vegetables and fruits getting wasted with the construction of several stores.  The proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to implement this project in accordance with the recommendations made by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management, was approved by the Cabinet.",
