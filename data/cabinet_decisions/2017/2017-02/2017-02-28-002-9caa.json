  "decision_details": "- The Coast Guard Department of Sri Lanka is entrusted with the duty of patrolling in maritime waters covering approximately 517,000 sq.m of the sea area around Sri Lanka to conduct search and rescue operations and as well as to carry out observations necessary to enforce law and order in the coastal areas.  In order to carry out this activity successfully, it is essential for the Department to have the required marine platforms capable of operating in both coastal and high seas, where necessary.
