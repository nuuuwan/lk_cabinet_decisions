  "decision_details": "- The Government of Sri Lanka is committed to providing legal assistance and counselling and other services to women who face various types of violence and seek relief/protection from such violence and in addition, for conducting relief centres/temporary shelters. Although, the Government has constructed temporary protection shelters for women in need, in Jaffna, Batticaloa, Mullativu and Ratnapura Districts the administrative activities of such shelters have not yet been commenced due to the dearth of resource personnel.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara, the Minister of Women and Child Affairs, to maintain the temporary shelters established in Jaffna, Batticaloa, Mullativu and Ratnapura Districts in collaboration with the Non-governmental Organizations which have the experience in such activities and to provide Government sponsorship for the temporary women protection shelters established in Colombo and Matara Districts and administered by a Non-governmental Organization, was approved by the Cabinet.",
