  "decision_details": "- Due to delay in the rains and the inadequate rainfall experienced during the Maha Season 2016/2017, the extent of cultivation has been reduced in almost all parts of  the Island.  Accordingly, the reduction in the expected yield and an unfavourable impact on seed production is anticipated.  It is apparent that a shortage of seed paddy may also be experienced during the coming Maha Season of 2017/2018. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to procure the required seed paddy for the 2017 Yala Season and the 2017/2018 Maha Season from the Department of Agriculture and the seed paddy cultivators and distribute same among the farmers at a concessionary rate to ensure the food security of the country, was approved by the Cabinet.",
