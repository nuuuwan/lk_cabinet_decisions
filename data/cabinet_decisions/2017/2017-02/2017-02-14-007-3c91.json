  "decision_details": "- At present, although the public sector has been widened with the public employee ratio being increased to 1 public servant per every 15 citizens, there is a discontentment about the public service delivery among the people despite the allocations set apart annually, as a result of the slow progress achieved in the expected goals.  There is also a dearth of public servants employed specially in the fields of education and health in the rural and remote areas while the public servants employed in the Government Institutions in the urban and the suburban areas exceed even the approved cadre at institutional level.  Also the number of the staff at the Primary Level is higher in number compared to the number of Senior and the Tertiary Staff. Accordingly, the information submitted by Hon. Ravi Karunanayke, the Minister of Finance, to the effect that a review is undertaken by the Ministry of Finance in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Administration and Management, the National Salaries and Cadre Commission and the Finance Commission, pertaining to the cadre requirements of the public sector and as well as the Provincial Councils and that the cadre requirements of the above institutions will be determined based on the information gathered through the Department of Management Services Circular No.1/2017 of 2017\u201101\u201111 issued giving instructions on conducting a cadre review, was noted by the Cabinet.",
