  "decision_details": "- In providing a quality healthcare service, a special consideration should be made with regard to the sanitation of the patients.  In this process, it is compulsory to categorize the clothes used of patients, bedsheets, the clothes of patients undergoing surgery and the clothes used by the staff of  the operation theatres, sterilize and to wash and dry them in the proper manner as stipulated.  At present, washing of the hospital laundry is very often carried out by private parties and it has been observed that the activity is not conducted in a satisfactory level. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne,  the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to implement a project for the construction and maintenance of a Washing Plant for the hospital laundry in the hospitals situated within the Western Province, was approved by the Cabinet.",
