  "decision_details": "- Since it has been assessed that, the need of aviation fuel will be increased in the future with the modernization activities carried out presently in the Bandaranaike International Airport and as such, the establishment of a pipe line exclusively for the transport of aviation fuel from Muthurajawela terminal to the BIA is necessary to enable the Lanka Petroleum Corporation to supply aviation fuel to meet the increasing demand.  Through a feasibility study made in this regard, it has been proposed to construct 04 steel tanks with a total operational capacity of 75,000 Cu.M. exclusively for aviation fuel and a pipe line of  23 Km in length and to carry out the development activities connected with it.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, the Minister of Petroleum Resources Development, to appoint a Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and a Technical Evaluation Committee to call for bids following the open International Competitive Bidding Procedure, was approved by the Cabinet.",
