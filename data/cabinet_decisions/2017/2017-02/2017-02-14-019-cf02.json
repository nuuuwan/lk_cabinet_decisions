  "decision_details": "- In view of the public transport system prevailing at present, is not efficient and dependable, most of the public is more inclined to use private modes of transport instead of the public transport services. This situation has caused in the increase of heavy traffic congestion, accidents and air pollution and high fuel import expenditure. With the creation of an efficient, dependable and a comfortable public transport service, a majority of those who make use of their private mode of transport would be attracted to use the public transport service to come to the city. The public transport service network is also required to be improved as a whole with fixed schedules for integrated train and bus travel services.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to modernize the fleet of buses of the Transport Board and to procure 900, 40-46 high back seater (2x2) new buses and 100 new low floor AC buses for the Sri Lanka Transport Board through the Indian Line of Credit, to maintain an adequate fleet strength to meet the operational needs, was approved by the Cabinet.",
