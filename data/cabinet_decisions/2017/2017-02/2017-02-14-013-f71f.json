  "decision_details": "- The Philatelic Bureau of the Department of Posts established in the year 1967, produce and sell the stamps and the associated items for the local and foreign stamp collectors.  Foreign exchange could be earned from selling stamps  specially to the foreign stamp collectors and there is also a tendency for the foreign stamp collectors to visit the country as tourists due to the attraction for the environment of the country, the natural beauty, the archaeological sites, wild animals and the sceneries of birds displayed on the stamps. As such, it is essential to have the agents who introduce the stamps of Sri Lanka to foreigners and therefore, the proposal made by Hon. M.H.A. Haleem, the Minister of Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs, for the appointment of foreign agents and also to enter into Agreements with them, was approved by the Cabinet.",
