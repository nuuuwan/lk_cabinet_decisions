  "decision_details": "- Fifteen various state award ceremonies and several commemoration ceremonies are annually conducted by the Department of Cultural affairs with a view to preserving, promoting and propagating the cultural heritage of Sri Lanka. Certain state award ceremonies are conducted continuously for more than a half century and this has been greatly helpful in cultural renaissance of high quality and standard. \n\nThe amount of the cash awards presented to the winners at these state award ceremonies has not been enhanced for a long period of time. Further, the organizational cost for these ceremonies too has gone up considerably and additional provisions are also necessary, since a few new state award ceremonies are being organized to be held in respect of major fields of Arts which have not been subject to appreciation up to now, at State level. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Navinne, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, to enhance the provision of Rs.55 million presently set apart annually by the General Treasury up to Rs.100 million, for the state award ceremonies conducted to facilitate the Artists in different fields, was approved by the Cabinet.",
