  "decision_details": "- It has been found that the old building where the Gampaha District Secretariat is housed at present is not suitable to provide an efficient and effective service to the general public. The relocation of the Government and Semi-Government institutions, presently scattered in several places, within the District Secretariat premises would also result in minimizing the traffic congestion in the Gampaha town.  \n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Vajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Home Affairs, to construct a 07 storey building complex with approximately  200,000 square feet, at an estimated cost of Rs 2,960 million for the Gampaha District Secretariat, was approved by the Cabinet.",
