  "decision_details": "- The Government places a high priority on the development of infrastructure facilities. As such, it is essential to complete the infrastructure facility projects within the duration and the cost agreed upon while also maintaining the required qualitative standards. However, it has been found that in the investment of funds, the difficulties faced by the local contractors engaged in certain infrastructure facility projects implemented by the Government due to various reasons has been a constraint to complete the activities taken over by them within the due time period and the qualitative standards.   \n\n\tAs a remedial measure, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to introduce a suitable mechanism to ease the cash flow situation of contractors, was approved by the Cabinet.",
