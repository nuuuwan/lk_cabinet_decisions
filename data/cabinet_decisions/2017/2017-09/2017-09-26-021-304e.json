  "decision_details": "- The government has launched a programme to improve the contribution of the renewable energy sources for electricity generation in Sri Lanka and the priority has been given for electricity generation by solar power.  Under the 'Sooryabala Sangramaya' project, the opportunity has been given to any customers to generate electricity by solar power and derive an income by supplying the same to the National Electricity Grid. \n \nEven though there is a potential for solar power electricity generation in the Provinces such as Western and Sabaragamuwa where the demand for electricity is high in Sri Lanka, there are difficulties in acquiring the lands required for the purpose. An area of 3 - 5 acres is generally required for a land mounted solar power electricity generation project with the capacity of 1 MW. Accordingly,   the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to utilize the abandoned and uncultivated paddy lands in the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces for the solar power electricity generation projects with the concurrence of the Commissioner General of Agrarian Services and the other authorities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
