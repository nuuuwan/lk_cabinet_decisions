  "decision_details": "- For the purpose of achieving international success in sports, inherent talents and traditional training methods alone will not suffice but the use of modern technology and correct and updated training methods and dynamics are also essential.  In the international sports arena, the developed countries use the facilities of 'Human Performance Laboratories' which analyze the human motion and the structural shortcomings in order to keep the skills of the sportsmen/women at an optimal level by preventing sports injuries.  \n\nThe construction of such a Human Performance Laboratory has commenced in Sri Lanka as well and the activities pertaining to it will be completed this year.  This laboratory will provide immense assistance to keep the skills of the  sportsmen/women at an optimal level.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.
