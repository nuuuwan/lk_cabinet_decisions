  "decision_details": "- At present, there is a significant increase in the risk of the people being subject to heart diseases.  Therefore, it is essential to improve the facilities in the Cardiac Treatment Units of the hospitals.  The Provincial General Hospital in Badulla is the only hospital in the Uva Province, which provides specialized treatment services for heart diseases. Around 10,000 patients arrive in its Cardiology Clinics annually and about 1,500 out of them are admitted to the Cardiac Treatment Unit.  Even though more than 1,000 patients out of them are required to have Catheterization for diagnostic purposes, the facilities available at the hospital at the moment are inadequate for such a number. \n\nAs such, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to establish a Catheterization Laboratory with the relevant clinical treatment facilities and an Intensive Care Unit at the Provincial General Hospital in Badulla, at the estimated cost of Rs.698 million within the financial assistance of the Japan International Cooperation  Agency (JICA), was approved by the Cabinet.",
