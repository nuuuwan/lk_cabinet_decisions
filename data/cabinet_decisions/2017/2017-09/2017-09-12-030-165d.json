  "decision_details": "- In providing a high qualitative health care service, the contribution of the Nursing Officers is of paramount importance. The Government has identified that the facilities of the Nurses Training School in Colombo have to be improved to fulfill the need of increasing the number of trained Nursing Officers with high skills and the knowledge of scientific and up to date information. The Nurses Training School in Colombo established in the year 1939 is one of the major Training Schools in the country and the facilities available there, at present, is sufficient only to train 100 Nurses annually. As such, it has been planned to construct a building consisting of five storeys to improve the facilities of the Nurses Training School in Colombo to enable around 600 Nursing Students to be trained annually. Accordingly,  the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to award the contract to the State Engineering Corporation with a view to implementing the project expeditiously, was approved by the Cabinet.",
