  "decision_details": "- Certain state functions, conferences, seminars, public gatherings and discussions relevant to the District of Galle and the entire Southern Province, are held in places close to the town of Galle. The Hall de Galle belonging to the Ministry of Home Affairs is mostly used for these activities at present and the existing facilities and space available are  not sufficient to carryout such activities. Therefore, a new Auditorium has been proposed to be constructed for the District Secretariat of Galle.  \n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Vajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Home Affairs, to construct an Auditorium of 2,000 seats with modern facilities, adjacent to the road having access to the Southern Expressway, to be used as a public Auditorium for such events held in the town of Galle, was approved by the Cabinet.",
