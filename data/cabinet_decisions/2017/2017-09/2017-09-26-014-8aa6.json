  "decision_details": "- The necessity of upgrading the healthcare facilities in the Sabaragamuwa Province  where around 9% of the total population of Sri Lanka are living  has been identified. As the Provincial General Hospital in Ratnapura and the District General Hospital in Kegalle, the major hospitals in the province are highly congested, it has been identified that it will be essential to develop the Base Hospitals of Mawanella, Karawanella, Balangoda and Kalawana and the  Divisional Hospitals of Rambukkana and Eheliyagoda where people can have easy access and have quality healthcare service. Accordingly, it is expected to establish different new clinics and treatment units and to increase the number of beds by 250 in each hospital. Therefore,  the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to implement the proposed project at an estimated cost of Rs.1,547 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
