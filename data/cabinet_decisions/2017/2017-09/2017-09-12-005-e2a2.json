  "decision_details": "- The hearing impaired population living in Sri Lanka is reported to be 389,677.  In terms of the National Policy on Disability, Sign Language has been accepted as the language of communication of the profoundly hearing impaired persons. With the establishment of the Sign Language, as a recognized language it ensures the hearing impaired persons right to education and paves the way for them to have access to  the services provided by the Government without any discrimination.   Affording  equal opportunities in this manner to the hearing impaired persons will enhance their self esteem as well.  \n\n\n\nAccordingly, with the objective of making legal provision to establish the Sign Language as a recognized language in Sri Lanka, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, for drafting the proposed Draft Bill on Sign Language, was approved by the Cabinet.",
