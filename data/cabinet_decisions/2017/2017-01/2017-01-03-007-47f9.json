  "decision_details": "- Around 1,600 students take up the Bachelor of Technology Degree in the University of Vocational Technology at Ratmalana and there is a gradual increase of the number of applicants applying for these courses.  Further, a considerable number of these students are residents from remote areas away from Colombo. This University does not have adequate  hostel facilities to provide accommodation facilities for these students and even in the present canteen the space available is highly limited. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training, to construct a new hostel to cater for 600 students, a canteen with 300 seating capacity at one and the same time and also a vocational training workshop to provide facilities for students, at an estimated cost of Rs.927.34 Million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
