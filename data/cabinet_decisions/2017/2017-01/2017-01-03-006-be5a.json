  "decision_details": "- When providing essential healthcare services and curative and treatment services to the people through the hospital system, diagnosis and treatment of the deceases and the outcome assessment pertaining to administrative decisions, planning and monitoring activities should be carried out properly.  In this respect, availability of an accurate, reliable, relevant and an easily accessible and cost effective information network is of paramount importance to provide health services more effectively. The National Health Information Network of Sri Lanka is mainly comprised of information inputs from the State health service and in future most of the information inputs of the private sector institutions which provide healthcare services will be included in the above information network.  It is also a felt need to improve the paper based system of data capture and transfer same with the use of the modern information and communication technologies.  Accordingly, the 'National Policy on Health Information' formulated in accordance with the objectives of the 'National Health Services Policy' and submitted by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, was approved by the Cabinet.",
