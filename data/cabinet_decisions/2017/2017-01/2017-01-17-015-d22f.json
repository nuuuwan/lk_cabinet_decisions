  "decision_details": "- As the storing facilities available in the Medical Supplies Division of the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine are inadequate, a sum of nearly Rs.1 Million per month is incurred as rent for the storage facilities to be obtained from the private sector.  Therefore, considering the long term storage facilities needed, a pre-fabricated structured building has been planned to be constructed at the Welisara Hospital Premises, to ensure uninterrupted medical supplies to the hospital.  Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senarathe, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to award the contract for the construction of the stores building, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), was approved by the Cabinet.",
