  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Cancer Society inaugurated in 1948, is a voluntary organization committed to serving the patients suffering physically and mentally from cancer.

Therefore, as Government sponsorship for renovation and maintenance activities and considering the services provided by it as a voluntary organization, the proposal made by Hon. Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to increase the grant of Rs.550,000/- to Rs.2,000,000, was approved by the Cabinet.",
