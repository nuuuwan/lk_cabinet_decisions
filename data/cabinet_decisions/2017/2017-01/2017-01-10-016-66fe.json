  "decision_details": "- At present approximately 10,500 students follow the courses conducted in Management, Information Technology and Language Studies by the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) located at Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 07 and the demand for such courses is gradually increasing.  However, due to the limited space available at the current premises, it has become difficult to meet the increasing demand and commence new courses. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training and Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to expand the scope of the infrastructure facilities of the National Institute of Business Management with the allocation of a land of about 45 perches belonging to the Department of Agriculture situated adjoining  the NIBM, to construct a new building, was approved by the Cabinet.",
