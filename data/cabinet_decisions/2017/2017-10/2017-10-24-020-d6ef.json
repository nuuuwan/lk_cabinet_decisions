  "decision_details": "- The Port of Colombo is functioning as a major container hub port in the South Asian Region and the other countries in the region are engaged in the development and modernization of the facilities and processes of their ports with the aim of bringing them into prominence. In this background, the Port of Colombo has to face severe competition and therefore, the software system used in the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) and the Unity Container Terminal (UCT) operated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in the Port of Colombo has to be updated expeditiously.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to upgrade the current Terminal Management Software (TMS) System used by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, utilizing the funds of the Authority and to appoint a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) and a Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), to take action in that regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
