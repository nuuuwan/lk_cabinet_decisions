  "decision_details": "- 332 Samurdhi General Councils and 1,074 Samurdhi Community based banks  function island-wide presently. It has become a timely need to upgrade the facilities of those buildings where the branches of these Samurdhi banks are located. Accordingly, a proposal has been made to establish the Wattegama Samurdhi Community Based Bank in the Kandy District, which is presently maintained amidst various shortcomings in a place that is  really difficult  to access, in a location where the public could be served conveniently. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, to vest a state land of 20 perches located at Wattegama, with the Department of Samurdhi Development, was approved by the Cabinet.",
