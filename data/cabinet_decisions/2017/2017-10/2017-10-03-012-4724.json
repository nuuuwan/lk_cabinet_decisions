  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that the remaining sand in the pit reserved for the completion of reclamation activities of the Colombo Port City Development Project, is not sufficient to complete the said task. A further 40 million m3 cubes of sand is required for the purpose and it is possible for the said quantum to be obtained from the sea sand pit reserved for the purposes of the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation. \n\nAccording to the Tripartite Agreement related to the project, the Government of Sri Lanka is committed to supplying the sand required for the project free of charge. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to supply the required quantum of sand, subject to US$ 2 million being paid as a lump-sum as  administrative and other costs to the the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation by the Colombo Port City Project Company,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
