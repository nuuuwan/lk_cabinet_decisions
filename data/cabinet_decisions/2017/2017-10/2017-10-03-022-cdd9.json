  "decision_details": "- Concurrent with the decline of beef consumption in the country, the demand for mutton consumption has gone up due to the promotion of tourism as well as various social reasons. However, the mutton production in the country is not sufficient to meet the local demand. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to import 100 Boer Goats including 90 females and 10 males by the Department of Animal Production and Health for the purpose of crossbreeding goats and supply of Boer stud goats to commercial farms, with a view to increasing the mutton production, was approved by the Cabinet.",
