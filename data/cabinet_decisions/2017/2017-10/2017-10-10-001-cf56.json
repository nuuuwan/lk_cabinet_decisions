  "decision_details": "- The Montreal Protocol was formed by the world community in the year 1987 for the purpose of regulating the use of chemicals which cause damages to the Orzone Layer and the gradual phase down of the same. Sri Lanka is a party to the Protocol and has demonstrated commitment to the amendments made to the protocol from time to time. The last amendment to the Montreal Protocol was made in Kigali, Rwanda, on the 15th of October, 2016 and by this amendment all parties have agreed to control the global warming by the gradual phase down of the use of refrigerants like Hydroflurocarbons which contribute to global warming, by the year 2050.\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to ratify the Kigali Amendment by Sri Lanka considering the fact that Sri Lanka has already commenced the necessary activities and awareness to limit the use of Hydroflurocarbons in a manner avoiding an impact on the industrial sector and the economy of Sri Lanka and to present it in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
