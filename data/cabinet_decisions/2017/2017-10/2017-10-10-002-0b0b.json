  "decision_details": "- Providing adequate facilities and a proper mechanism to the local authority institutions for solid waste management has become a timely need.  It has been identified that it is appropriate to provide solutions for the purpose through a proper system implemented at District level. In this connection, a proposal has been made to construct a sanitary land fill for the Gampaha District where more urbanized solid waste is collected due to the dense population and the rapid industrialization taking place. \n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to implement a project for the establishment of a sanitary land fill and a carbonic fertilizer production yard by the Central Environmental Authority at a cost of Rs.989 million for the formal management of the solid waste collected by all local authorities of the Gampaha District, was approved by the Cabinet.",
