  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that most of the Public Market Complexes built in the  major town centres of the Western Province, a number of decades before, using   substantial extents of land, are in a very primitive and dilapidated condition. As such, it has been proposed to renovate these Market Complexes managed by the Local Authorities to suit the present trends to make the optimum use of such space for commercial purposes.             \n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development to implement a project, for the development of the Public Market Complexes situated at Collpetty, Bambalapitiya, Borella, Nugegoda, Maharagama, Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Moratuwa and Katubedda with the state of the art facilities under a joint formal methodology adopted by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the relevant local authorities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
