  "decision_details": "- The College of Technology in Jaffna is the only institute functioning under the Department of Technical Education and Training for providing quality vocational training opportunities to the youth in the Jaffna District. The college receives approximately 8,000 applications annually for admission to courses but the facilities available in the Technical College are sufficient only for about 1,500 trainees. \n\nTaking this situation into consideration, a proposal has been made to establish  a technical college at Meesalai North, Thenmarachchi at Walikamam  where it has been designed to conduct several vocational courses pertaining to the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 3 and 4. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Chandima Weerakkody, the Minister of  Skills Development and Vocational Training, to construct the said technical college at a cost of Rs 560 million, within the next two years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
