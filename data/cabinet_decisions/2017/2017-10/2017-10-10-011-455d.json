  "decision_details": "- Due to the high level of competition and commercialization, it is observed that  athletes, presently, have a tendency to make use of nutritional supplements containing drugs with or without their knowledge. Since the adverse effects of these are likely to surface during the up coming international competitions, the necessary measures should be taken to prevent such situation. Therefore, it is appropriate to make aware of the athletes of National and School level, their parents, coaches and the Sports Managers as well of the prohibited substances and the preventive methods. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Minister of Sports, to implement an awareness programme to promote a dope free sport protecting the lively spirit of sports and to allocate  funds required for the provision of facilities to carry out the dope control programmes in Sri Lanka creating awareness of prohibited substances and preventive methods, was approved by the Cabinet.",
