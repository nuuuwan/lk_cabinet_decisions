  "decision_details": "- The risk of contacting non\u2011communicable diseases has increased considerably due to unhealthy food practices, use of tobacco and alcohol and physical inactivity. Especially, the individuals who do not engage in physical exercises have become highly prone to heart diseases. Surveys have revealed that  diseases such as diabetes and cancer can be prevented by engaging more in  physical exercises and getting accustomed to healthy foods. \n\nBy promoting sports among the general public, it would be possible to provide them with more opportunities to engage in physical activities. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Minister of Sports, to implement a project for the community based sports development, with a view to increasing the ratio of the community engaged in physical activities by 10% within the next three years, was approved in principle by the Cabinet.",
