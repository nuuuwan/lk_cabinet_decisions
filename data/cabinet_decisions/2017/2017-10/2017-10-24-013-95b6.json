  "decision_details": "- The legal base required for the implementation of the new Electoral System in all Local Authorities has been created by the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act, No.16 of 2017. These amendments have brought about the election of a Member accountable to the Division and  ensured the Proportional Representation.  However, it has become apparent that the public understanding of these amendments is still not at a sufficient level. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs; Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government; and Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara, the Minister of Women and Child Affairs, to implement expeditious programmes to create awareness of the general public and the civil organizations in respect of the mixed proportional representation system introduced through the amendments to the Local Authorities Election System and the assurance of  women's representation expected therein, was approved by the Cabinet.",
