  "decision_details": "- By initiating the Ferry Services between Sri Lanka and India, it will be possible to establish a close relationship between the people of the two countries, uplift cultural and economic relations and promote trade, tourism and new employment opportunities. Even though the Expressions of Interest (EoI) were accordingly called to operate the project for the passenger ferry service between Colombo and Tuticorin, sufficient responses have not been received for this purpose.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to cancel the existing procurement procedure pertaining to this project, re-tender and select a suitable investor, was approved by the Cabinet.",
