  "decision_details": "- It is expected to grant houses for the beneficiaries at the end of this year from  several housing projects under the Government programme for granting housing facilities with clear title deeds to the plantation community living in line rooms.  \n\nAccordingly, it has been planned to grant title deeds for 2,551 houses constructed under the Green Gold Housing Programme, 1,134 houses of Phase I, constructed under the Indian Grant for families affected by disasters in the year 2017, and  75 houses of the Meeriyabedda Housing Project,  implemented   for people who had lost their houses due to disasters in the year 2015. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. U. Palani Digambaram, the Minister of  Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development,  to get the plots of land  on which the relevant housing schemes are implemented, released from the regional plantation companies for the issue of such title deeds, was approved by the Cabinet.",
