  "decision_details": "- A Condominium Apartment Complex with 500 housing units is being constructed in a block of land 05 acres in extent, for the purpose of resettling the low income families in the city of Colombo under the 'Urban Regeneration Project (URP)' and its construction work is nearing completion.  However, due to various reasons, practical difficulties have cropped up in resettling of the low income families residing in the city of Colombo, in the areas outside the Colombo city limits.  \n\n\tTherefore, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to call for applications by way of paper advertisements and sell these housing units valued at an amount between Rs.4-5 million each, to the groups of lower middle income public officers and the Members of the Tri Forces, Artists, Small and Medium Scale Entrepreneurs and Civil Activists, was approved by the Cabinet.",
