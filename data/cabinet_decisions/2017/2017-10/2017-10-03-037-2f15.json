  "decision_details": "- Surveying and mapping of around 2.5 million allotments of lands alienated to the public by the government for residential, agricultural and other purposes without formal survey plans and the issuance of title certificates with clear survey plans for private blocks of lands islandwide have become a timely need.   In this context, the process of surveying and issuing title certificates needs to be modernized by adopting the technical and professional methodologies used by the developed countries. \n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Gayantha Karunathilaka, the Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms, to authorize the Department of External Resources to negotiate the matters in the project proposal presented by the Trimble Inc. of the United States of America to carry out the said modernization process and to commence a pilot project to examine the technical feasibility prior to initiating the main project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
