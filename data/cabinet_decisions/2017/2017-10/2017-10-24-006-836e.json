  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted to implement a programme for  granting permanent houses for 14,860 families living in high risk landslide zones, identified by the National Buildings and Research Organization to be settled in a safe location. As such, the programme is being implemented at present  through the District Secretaries. \n\nIn addition to the said programme, District Secretaries have pointed out that it is appropriate that families whose houses were completely damaged due to the flood disaster that occurred in the year 2017 and are due to be resettled in a safe location, are also given houses on the same basis on which the above programme was implemented. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, the Minister of Disaster Management, to construct 1,122 houses in safe areas, for the resettlement of families in 05 districts, who  live in high risk flood zones and whose houses were damaged due to the floods, was approved by the Cabinet.",
