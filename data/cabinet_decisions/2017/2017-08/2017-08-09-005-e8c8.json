  "decision_details": "- The accumulated loss of the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport as at 31st December 2016 which runs at a loss presently, is US$ 112.9 million (equivalent to Rs.15,600 million). In the circumstances, carrying out the operational activities of this Airport further incurring losses is a substantial financial burden on the Government. As such, with a view to converting the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport into a high revenue deriving Airport under the Public Private Partnership framework, proposals have been invited from Investors dealing with the aviation related ventures.  However, no proposals have yet been received to cover the entire operation of the Airport, Management and Maintenance. In the meantime, a proposal has been submitted by the Government of India to commence a joint venture focusing attention not only on the commercial Air Services of the Mattala International Airport, Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul, and flying schools but also in the areas of its operation, management, maintenance and the development.   Accordingly, the proposal made by  Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to appoint a Committee comprising of several senior Secretaries to Ministries to make a further study on the matter, was approved by the Cabinet.",
