In order to achieve this target, concessionary loans will be provided to install Rooftop Solar Power Generation Systems under the 'Solar Power Generation Project'.  The Asian Development Bank has consented to assist this programme by providing concessionary loan assistance for developing solar rooftop market infrastructure, to arrange sub\u2011projects to obtain loans and to increase the capacity and awareness of commercial and domestic consumers including the stakeholders. As such, the proposal made by Hon.
