  "decision_details": "- According to the information available with the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, it is found that more than 15% of the couples suffer from sub\u2011fertility and at times this situation turns out to be a psychological and a life crisis. Although, Sri Lanka has achieved the maternal and child care health service indexes close to the level of the developed countries, it is observed that the focus made on the management of sub\u2011fertility is not quite adequate. \n\nTherefore, the facilities such as psychological counseling for couples suffering from sub\u2011fertility, proper guidance and early referral at times of need have to be established within the Government health care services.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to commemorate the National Family Planning Day which falls on the 26th of September under the theme of planning for a cherished little baby, focusing attention of the general public as well as the health care workers on the problem of sub\u2011fertility, was approved by the Cabinet.",
