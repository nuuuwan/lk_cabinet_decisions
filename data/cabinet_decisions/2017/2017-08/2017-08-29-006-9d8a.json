  "decision_details": "- Wedithalathivu nature reserve with an extent of 29,180 hectares, declared as a nature reserve under the Gazette Extraordinary Notification No. 1956/13 of 2016\u201103\u201101 is a natural reserve found in the wet lands of Sri Lanka with a vital mangrove Eco\u2011system. The project to establish ''an aquaculture industrial zone'' in Manthai-West Divisional Secretariat Division in the Mannar District is immensely important out of the different projects that have been designed by the Government, with a view to increasing the export income of fish products up to  US$ 1.3 billion by 2020. The land in extent of 1,491 hectares identified to establish the said aquaculture industrial zone, being included in the said Wedithalathivu nature reserve has proved to be a hindrance to the implementation of the project.  \n\nAccordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife and Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of  Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, to conduct a proper environmental impact assessment and subject to the results of same and in accordance with the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance to exclude the plot of land identified as suitable to establish the proposed Aquaculture Industrial Zone from the Wedithalathivu Nature Reserve and re-declare the boundaries of the said Reserve, was approved by the Cabinet.",
