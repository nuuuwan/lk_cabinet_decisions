  "decision_details": "- More than 2000 families in the Bandarawela and Ella Divisional Secretariat Divisions have been affected due to the water level in their wells being low as a result of the water ingress during the tunneling construction of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Scheme. With the result, the demand for pipe water connections by the families who used their own wells have increased and along with that, the capacity of the Bandarawela Water Supply Scheme has to be enhanced.\n \nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, to implement a project to increase the water capacity of the Bandarawela Water Supply Scheme by additional 2,000 cubic meters per day enabling to make 1,000 new connections including the affected areas of Egodagama, Weheragalathanna, Udaperuwa, Kinigama and Heeloya, at an estimated cost of Rs.225 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
