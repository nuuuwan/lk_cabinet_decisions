There seems to be an international trend also for job markets in the fields of computer, mathematics, architecture, engineering, product design, robotics and other emerging technologies such as Nano\u2011Technology, biotechnology and the knowledge obtained through the STEM education would be beneficial in obtaining a highly paid job. Several developed countries in the globe are taking action to promote STEM education as a measure to improve the industrial sector in their countries. \n\nAccordingly, taking into consideration a proposal made by Hon.
