  "decision_details": "- The Government has given priority for the resettlement of the people in their own villages, who were displaced due to the conflict situation which prevailed in the Northern and Eastern provinces. The Security Forces assist in the matter  by establishing their Camps in other locations, which had been located previously in the lands possessed by the civilians.  Hence, 432 acres of private lands situated in the Keppapilavu village in the Mullaitivu District in the possession of the Security Forces have already been released by now and the Army Commander has agreed to release a further 111 acres of private lands for the resettlement of displaced persons.  Accordingly, in order to release the occupied extent of lands, the proposal made by Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, to secure the funds required for the establishment of the Army Camps in other locations which had been previously situated in those lands, was approved by the Cabinet.",
