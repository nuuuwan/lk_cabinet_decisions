  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Planetarium which is one of the largest Planetariums in the world with a 23 meter diameter dome has seating facilities to accommodate 500 visitors per session. This planetarium constructed using the pre-fabricated concrete plates technology has not been subject to modernization during recent times. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Science, Technology and Research, to refurbish the dome and the surrounding sections of the Planetarium buildings identified as necessary to be refurbished expeditiously, was approved by the Cabinet.",
