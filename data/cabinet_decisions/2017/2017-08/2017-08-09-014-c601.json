  "decision_details": "- The Civil Procedure Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure contain provisions to the effect that a certified copy of the judgment or the final decree can be issued to each party to the case upon payment of a fee.  However, it has been observed that the parties to certain cases do not possess the money necessary to obtain copies of such judgment or final decree. As such, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Justice, to amend the Civil Procedure Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, incorporating provisions to enable the issuance of a  certified copy of a judgment or a decree free of charge to each party to the case, for ensuring the dispensation of justice and for the betterment of the judicial system, was approved by the Cabinet.",
