  "decision_details": "- The core issue existing within the judicial sector in Sri Lnka is the delay in the dispensing of cases. Measures are being taken by the Government to provide a solution to the issue under four pronged strategies namely, law reforms, judicial infrastructure development, court automation and capacity building. Of these, under the 'Court Automation' File Management System, it is expected to establish digital facilities in Courts for filing of cases and the efficient management of case files for which Rs.500 million has been allocated in the budget estimate of 2016. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Justice, to call for proposals from the institutions which possess technical and financial capacity, with a view to expediting the project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
