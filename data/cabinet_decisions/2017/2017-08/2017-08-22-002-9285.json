  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that when purchasing SIM cards,  a large number of active connections without the proper documentation containing the correct information of the owner of the SIM card are presently in the network of the companies which provide cellular mobile phones. It is essential to register the mobile phone subscribers with information required to ensure the identity of the legitimate subscriber, in order to control the various crimes and fraudulent acts committed with the use of mobile phones, in the interest of the national security and public order. The Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has already made a request from the cellular mobile companies which supply mobile phones to adopt the procedure of registering SIM cards after obtaining a duly completed application form and a copy of the National Identity card including the other necessary documents of the person using the SIM card. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, for the  Minister in\u2011charge of the subject to issue an Order under the Sri Lanka Telecommunication Act, No.25 of 1991 to implement the registration procedure in a proper manner and to authorize the TRCSL to implement same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
