Each student is granted is Rs.5,000/- per month and it costs a monthly total of Rs.160 million. 51% of it is borne by the Mahapola fund while 49% is granted by the General Treasury. Considering that the expenditures such as hostel charges, telephone charges, etc should be borne, since student education is continued using distant education methods although Universities are kept closed, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the payment of allowances to Mahapola scholarship holders precisely after accomplishing the sufficient allocations required.",
