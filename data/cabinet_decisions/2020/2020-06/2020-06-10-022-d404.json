  "decision_details": "- The Circuit Bungalow of the Forest Department is located in a 2 Acre 22.6 perch land plot adjoining the Mirisawetiya MahaViharaya. The Department of Archaeology has informed that no new constructions should be done there since this land is situated within the Anuradhapura sacred city and it is an area with archaeological ruins. The Chief Incumbent of the Mirisavatiya Viharaya has requested this land for the Miriswetiya Viharaya for the ease of carrying out religious and social activities of the temple in the future as the relevant land plot is situated adjoining the Mirisawetiya Maha Viharaya. Accordingly, the Cabinet approval was given to allocate this land to the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Cultural and Religious Affairs to be transferred to the Mirisawetiya Maha Viharaya upon the approval of the Sacred Area Development Committee in future when formally declaring the boundaries of the said sacred area.",
