  "decision_details": "Continuous maintenance of the operational activities of tea factories, relative decline of the procurement power of most of the countries that import tea, supply chain management issues as well as continuous maintenance of quality in the products are the major issues that were faced by the tea industry amidst the COVID 19 pandemic conditions, prevailing within the country at present.
