  "decision_details": "- The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance has been amended in the years 1984 and 1986. However, several people in the field of legal profession have pointed out that the provisions therein are not sufficient for present day requirements. Various parties have pointed out the need to reconsider the  provisions in the Act, especially, on the fact that some of the drugs currently in the circulation are not covered by this Act and on the existing provisions of giving equal punishments for drug addicts, persons who inadvertently involved in such activities and persons involved in large \u2013 scale drug trafficking. Accordingly, taking into consideration the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, the Cabinet granted approval to appoint a Committee comprising of the representation of the parties including Religious Leaders, Experts in the field of legal profession, Members of the  Security Forces, Conductors of Rehabilitation programmes for drug addicts for the purpose of obtaining recommendations to amend the said Ordinance in accordance with the present requirements and to amend the Ordinance based on the recommendations made by the aforesaid Committee.",
