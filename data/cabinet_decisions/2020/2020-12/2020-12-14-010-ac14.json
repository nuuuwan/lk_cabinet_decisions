  "decision_details": "- Kithul related production industry which is endemic to Sri Lanka is recognized as a highly potential industry for earning foreign exchange and various actions have been taken to uplift the Kithul industry during the previous periods. It has been found that expansion of Kithul related industry under the programme to create a public centred economy across the promotion of local products implemented by the present government is appropriate. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation to nominate Kithul crop as a major plantation crop and to establish the Kithul Development Board, was approved by the Cabinet.",
