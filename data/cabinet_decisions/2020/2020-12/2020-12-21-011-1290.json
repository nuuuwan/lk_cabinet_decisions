  "decision_details": "- Annual Fertilizer Requirement in Sri Lanka is about 340,000 metric tons. The entire quantity is currently being imported. In 2019,\u00a0 Rs.26 billion have been spent for importation of urea fertilizer. However, it is possible to save the foreign exchange spent on the importation of urea fertilizer through manufacturing of urea within the country itself and the Paranthan Chemicals Company Ltd. which is operated under the Ministry of Industries has focused its attention in that regard. Accordingly, considering the proposal made by the Minister of Industries with regard to the conduct of a feasibility study for the production of urea fertilizer in Sri Lanka, the Cabinet decided to entrust the Sri Lanka Institute of Nano Technology (Pvt) Ltd. to conduct the above feasibility study.",
