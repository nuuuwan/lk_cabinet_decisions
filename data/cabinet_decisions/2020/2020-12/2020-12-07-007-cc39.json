  "decision_details": "- The \"Children's Secretariat\" which has been established in the year 1979, functions as the central institution that executes the National Policy on Early Childhood Care and Development. Though the institute also plays a special role in the field of early childhood education, it seems that, the current institutional name of the said Secretariat does not imply that role. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to amend the institutional name of \u201cChildren's Secretariat\u201d as \u201cNational Secretariat for Early Childhood Development\u201d, was approved by the Cabinet.",
