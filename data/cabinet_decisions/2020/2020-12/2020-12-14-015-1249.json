  "decision_details": "- At present no buyer will buy a land with a Caveat and a land of that type can not be mortgaged to any  lending institution. Certain fraudulent people are found to have obtained Caveat orders from courts for certain lands which they have no legal right to claim ownership or interest and used such Caveat Orders as a tactical means of taking extortion from the actual owner.  In order to prevent the occurrence of such incidents, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to amend the Registration of Documents Ordinance as proposed by the Law Commission and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a bill for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
