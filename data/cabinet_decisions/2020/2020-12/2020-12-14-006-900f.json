  "decision_details": "- Since there is not any specific financial source for maintaining approximately 50,000 rural small scale rural tanks, anicuts and canal systems and cascade systems scattered throughout the island, it has been found difficult to maintain them. Due to this situation, it is observed that approximately 1,000 rural irrigation systems are destroyed at the end of monsoon rains of each year and  as a result of that, around 150,000 acres of cultivable paddy lands have been turned baron. As a remedy for the issue, an accelerated two year programme named \u2018Irrigation Prosperity\u2019 has been planned to be implemented in order to re - activate 5,000 small scale rural irrigation and drinking water systems under the guidance of the Presidential Task Force on Economic Revival and Poverty Alleviation with the objective of increasing the national food production. The proposed programme has been planned to be implemented deviating from the contract procedure and using human resources and machines owned by the Government with the participation of rural level religious leadership, farmer community, school system, youth community as well as the contribution of the Private sector, subject to obtaining labour from the rural farmer community  on daily payment basis as far as possible. Accordingly, the Cabinet considered the information submitted by the Minister of Irrigation, that the initiatives pertaining to the inauguration of the said programme for 1000 rural reservoirs, on 2021\u201102\u201104 has been organized.",
