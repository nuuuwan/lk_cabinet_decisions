  "decision_details": "- The \"Food Production National Program\", launched in the Yala season 2020 to reduce imports by cultivating locally grown crops, is now being successfully implemented. Since it is difficult for the Department of Agriculture alone to provide quality seeds to increase harvests and the area of cultivated lands the Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture to implement a formal program in collaboration with the Provincial and Inter-Provincial Departments of Agriculture and the Seed Producers' Institutions in the Mahaweli areas, enabling the farmers to produce their own  seed requirements in respective areas.",
