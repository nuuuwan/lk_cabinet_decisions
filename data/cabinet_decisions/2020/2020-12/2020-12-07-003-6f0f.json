  "decision_details": "- The income of the Central Cultural Fund has been declined due to the complete collapsing down of the tourism industry with the expansion of the global Corona pandemic. Although, actions have been taken previously to obtain a loan of Rs.135 million for the activities of the said fund having obtained the Cabinet approval, it has been observed that, the amount obtained is not sufficient for maintaining the institutional activities. Therefore, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of  Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs for obtaining Rs.50 million from the General Treasury for settling the bills relevant to the conservation and construction activities presently being performed by the institution, was approved by the Cabinet.",
