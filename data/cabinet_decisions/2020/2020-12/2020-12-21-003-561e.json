  "decision_details": "- Kolawenigama Raja MahaViharaya situated in Kotapola Divisional Secretariat division in Matara consists of numerous factors reflecting historical values along with a Stupa of more than 400 years old and an ancient Bo tree. The sacred area situated within a land in extent of 05 acres is governed under section 4(11) of Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931. Therefore, it is found necessary to focus attention on the unidentified heritages within the temple land premises. Accordingly, the Cabinet considered the information furnished by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development & Housing that the Department of National Physical Planning has taken initiatives to prepare a development plan in relation to the conservation of the Raja Maha Viharaya and accordingly, actions have been taken to declare the \u201cSacred premises of the Kolawenigama Raja Maha Viiharaya\u201d by the Gazette Notification in terms of the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Ordinance No. 13 of 1946.",
