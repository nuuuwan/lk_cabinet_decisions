  "decision_details": "- Lack of quality roughage has been identified as a major issue in large scale dairy farms belonging to the National Livestock Development Board and generally, one dairy cow should be fed with roughage of about 10% of her body weight. As a remedy to this situation, it has been planned to commence a Fodder Silage Baling Project within 1000 acres  of the Polonnaruwa farm of the National Livestock Development Board. As its initial stage, it has been planned to cultivate 1000 acres of nutritive maize and sorghum and produce mechanized baled silage and to import 2000 dairy cows and keep them in the farms as the second phase of the project, Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agricultur to obtain 60% of the total capital expenditure estimated for the project as a government contribution, was approved by the Cabinet.",
