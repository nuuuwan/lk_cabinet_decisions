  "decision_details": "- The Government of India has granted an award of Rs.300 million each for implementing 04 projects for the construction of houses for low \u2013 income families and the relevant projects are being implemented by the National Housing Development Authority. Steps will be taken to release applicable funds followed by a progress report submitted to the Indian High Commission by National Housing Development Authority upon the completion of the relevant construction by the beneficiaries with their cost. However, since the house owners do not have sufficient funds to complete the construction as supposed that the progress of the project lies at a lower level. Therefore the Indian High Commission has agreed to release the initial payment required for the construction at the inauguration of work and continue to release the rest of the instalments on the progress of the construction. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development & Housing for taking necessary action to implement the said projects,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
