  "decision_details": "- Around 150 Base hospitals and District hospitals are there in the Island,  equiped with facilities for medical tests included in the medical certificates issued by the National Transport Medical Institute for the issuance of Motor Vehicle License, Nevertheless when medical certificates are issued from such hospitals, it is not possible for the clients to obtain all services from the same place. As such, it has been identified that it is appropriate to establish a separate unit at the Government hospitals for this purpose. Accordingly, a proposal has been made by the Minister of Transport Services Management, to the Cabinet, to establish units with facilities at Government hospitals  enabling to provide the service recipients their medical certificates after conducting the relevant tests at  Government hospitals in accordance with  a format prepared by the National Transport Medical Institute and obtain all services in one place. Taking these mattes into consideration, Cabinet approval was granted to take appropriate measures to amend the Motor Traffic Act, No.8 of 2009, in a manner conferring authority, to the medical officers registered under the Medical Ordinance in order to issue the medical certificate considered for the issuance of driving license facilitating the implementation of such programme.",
