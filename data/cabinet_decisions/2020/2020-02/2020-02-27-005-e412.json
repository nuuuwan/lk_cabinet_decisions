  "decision_details": "- Action has already been initiated to establish a 'Sangeeth Ashram' known as 'Amaradeva Asapuva', comprising of an archives, a library and a museum at the 'Ape Gama' complex in Battaramulla in grateful commemoration of the invaluable national service rendered by Dr. Pandith Amaradeva to the field of music. Since the performance of the institution to which the construction activities of the project were entrusted, fell short of expectation, action has been taken to cancel the relevant Agreement. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Information and Mass Media, to select a suitable institution following the Government Formal Procurement Procedure in order to complete the said construction activities expeditiously, was approved by the Cabinet.",
