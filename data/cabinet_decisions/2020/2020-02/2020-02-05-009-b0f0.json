  "decision_details": "- Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Ltd., is a fully owned Government institution and the Kahatagaha Graphite mine belonging to it where its graphite mining activities are carried out exports around 65 to 70 MT of graphite per month in the form of raw materials. The supply of graphite from Sri Lanka is about 7% of the global requirement. Under the circumstances, there is no way of making an impact felt in the international market and as such, it has been identified that value addition for the graphite obtained through the excavation of Kahatagaha Mine is absolutely necessary. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Industries and Supply Chain Management,  to call for expressions of interest from both local and foreign investors under the competitive bidding system only in respect of  the activity of value addition process of the graphite supplied after excavation, and to implement the proposed project having selected a suitable investor on evaluation of the proposals submitted by a Project Committee and a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
