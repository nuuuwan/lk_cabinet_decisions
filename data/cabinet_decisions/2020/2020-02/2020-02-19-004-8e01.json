  "decision_details": "- Prior to commencing the production of aluminum powder by the private sector in the year 2003, the aluminum powder required for the country was imported by the Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation with the approval of the Ministry of Defence. However, with the relaxation of the legal restrictions that existed for the importation of aluminum powder, it is observed that aluminum power is being imported continually by the private sector without producing it locally. As such, the necessity for formulating legislation to prevent such situation has been identified. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of   Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare, to empower the Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation with the sole authority of importation and distribution of aluminum powder enabling it to import aluminum powder and issue same only to the licensed firework producers, licensed sale agents and for industries which use aluminum powder, as a raw material, was approved by the Cabinet.",
