  "decision_details": "- In terms of  Regulations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, it has been made compulsory to install a Satellite-Based Vessel Monitoring System on all Multiday Fishing Boats engaged in fishing operations at High Seas. According to the European Regulations, the countries exporting fish to the European Union too should get the Vessel Monitoring Systems installed. As such, 1,500 transponders have been provided for 1,500 multiday fishing boats registered under the Department of Fisheries and are engaged in fishing operations at high seas and with the  intervention of the Government. The contract awarded to supply the satellite services for the said transponders has been terminated by now and as such, the proposal made by the Minister of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources to set apart a sum of  Rs.13.5 million as the provision required to further obtain the satellite service through the Sri Lanka Telecom, was approved by the Cabinet.",
