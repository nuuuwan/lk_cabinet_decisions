  "decision_details": "- A moratorium of one year has been granted from the 01st of January 2020 to pay the Tourism Development Levy, which has to be paid by the Tourism Institutions registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority up to the 31st of December 2019. However, after the Easter Sunday attack, since the tourism arrivals have not increased to the extent expected, it is found appropriate that the relevant period of relief should be further extended. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism and Civil Aviation to extend the period of relief for the payment of the Tourism Development Levy by a further period of 04 months up to the 30th of April 2020 and to  recover the unpaid Tourism Development Levy relevant to the said period in 20 equal installments with effect from the 01st of May 2020, was approved by the Cabinet.",
