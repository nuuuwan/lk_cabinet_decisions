  "decision_details": "The number of permanent employees who hold the membership of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) currently is around 2.6 million. In accordance with the existing process, it has been found that it takes about a period of 06 to 12 months for the members of the EPF to get to know that their contributions are credited and therefore, the members are constantly confronted with a number of issues. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations to implement a mobile phone short massage service to a mobile number provided by the member that the contribution has been credited to his/her account instantly as it takes place, enabling him/her to receive a monthly confirmation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
