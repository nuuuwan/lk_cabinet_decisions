  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Police should maintain a skilled force in order to provide a proper service expected of them by the public. Presently, there is a considerable number of vacancies in the Sri Lanka Police and to make new recruitments, it will take a considerable period of time and need to incur a large amount of  expenditure to engage them in service after providing the necessary training. As such, it has been observed that a considerable number of experienced officers who have had the basic training and issued with vacation of post notices for various reasons could be re engaged in the police service within a short period of time by adopting an appropriate method. Hence, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development and Minister of Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare and State Minister of Defence to appoint a Committee to reconsider the appeals of the officers rejected for having not submitted their appeals within the prescribed period adhering to a proper and a transparent procedure and to reinstate the officers, who had vacated their posts, based on the recommendations of the said Committee with the approval of the relevant authorities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
