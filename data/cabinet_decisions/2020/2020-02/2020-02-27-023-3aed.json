  "decision_details": "- By the 'Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour' Policy Manifesto, a proposal has been made to implement a new programme for the cultivation of big onion and similar crops to convert the huge foreign exchange spent on importation of such crops into an income of the farmers engaged in growing such crops.\n\n\n\n\tIt has been identified that the formulation of a proper mechanism, to increase the Government guaranteed price of big onion in order to encourage the farmers to uplift their cultivation by giving them a reasonable price for the harvest and to utilize the lands more productively for cultivation, are of absolute importance.
