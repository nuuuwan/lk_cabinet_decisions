  "decision_details": "- More than one million Sri Lankans are employed in foreign countries and presently, they have become the main source of foreign exchange to the country. However, it has been observed that they are not motivated in making some saving  at least, for the use of their social security and their dependents and as a result they undergo economic difficulties when they reach their retirement age. As a solution to this, it has been proposed to initiate a contributory pension scheme for the migrant workers by the National Policy, 'Vistas of Prosperity and Splendor'.  Accordingly,  the proposal made by the Minister of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations to appoint an Experts Committee to prepare the preliminary draft for the draft Bill, for the creation of a contributory social security fund for the migrant workers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
