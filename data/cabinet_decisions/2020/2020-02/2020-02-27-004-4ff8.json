  "decision_details": "- More than 600 new children are diagnosed with cancer in a year by the Department of Pediatrics of the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka.  Although the survival of children with cancer in Sri Lanka is much better than the similar regional countries and the other countries in the world, it has been found that there is still a better scope to improve it further. For this purpose, it has been recognized that working in partnership with St. Jude Global Alliance Medical Institution which is a network of the global medical institutions specializing on treatment of pediatric oncology will provide the possibility of enhancing treatment on pediatric oncology. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Healthcare and Indigenous Medical Services, to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to join the St. Jude Global Alliance, as a member institute, was approved by the Cabinet.",
