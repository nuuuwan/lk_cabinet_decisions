  "decision_details": "- - A paddy cultivation programme utilizing traditional paddy varieties devoid of the use of chemical fertilizer and insecticides is being implemented by the 'Hela Suwaya' Organization centering the Rajangana area of the Anuradhapura District with the mediation of the Government Medical Officers' Association. It has been observed that lives of most of the people suffering from non\u2011communicable deceases could be saved from the consumption of the rice and the associated food products produced by this paddy. Taking these matters into consideration, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development, to engage 2000 farmers of the Ranjangana area in Anuradhapura within an extent of 10,000 acres to under take  Hela Suwaya  farming, was approved by the Cabinet.",
