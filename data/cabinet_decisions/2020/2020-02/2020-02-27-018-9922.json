  "decision_details": "- Due to the increase in the density of population and the present day pattern of consumption the disposal of waste to the environment has also increased. Presently, hand carts are used for waste transportation at narrow by-roads where the access of compactors or tractors are difficult. The Nation Eye Pvt. Limited which is a local innovator has manufactured a bicycle with a bucket named 'Kurumbettiya' which could easily enter such by-roads, with the minimum impact on the environment and could carry a weight around 250 - 300 kg. A proposal has been made to purchase 10 such bicycles and provide them to several local authorities as a pilot project and subsequently, distribute among other  local authorities based on its success. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils & Local Government to purchase 10 such multi-functional bicycles at the rate of Rs.180,000/- each for a sum of Rs.1.8 million and to provide them to local authorities where the places of religious and ancient monuments exist, was approved by the Cabinet.",
