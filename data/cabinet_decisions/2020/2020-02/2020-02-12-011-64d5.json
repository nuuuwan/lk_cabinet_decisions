  "decision_details": "The construction of the new Manning Market at Peliyagoda has been commenced in January 2016 and it has been planned to complete the construction work and open the market to the public in March 2020. The existing Gnanarathana Mawatha, which is the main access road to the new Manning Market at Peliyagoda when opened for both the Manning Market and the Fish Market complex, it is likely to create a huge road congestion on the existing expressway link road to Katunayake and hence, it will be required to expand a strip of road of 315M of length in that road within a very short time. Accordingly, in accordance with the recommendation of the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, the proposal made by the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Housing Facilities, to award the contract to M/s Maga Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd., engaged in the construction work of the super structure of the Manning Market complex, to improve and develop the relevant road section in concurrence with the said constructions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
