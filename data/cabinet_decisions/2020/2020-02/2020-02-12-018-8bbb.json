  "decision_details": "Despite fulfilling the requisite qualifications, a large number of male and female police officers in the post of  Police Constable to that of  Inspector of Police could not gain promotions as a proper procedure has not been followed to grant promotions for police officers during the recent past. It is observed that although the relevant Schemes of Recruitment had been approved, the promotions have not been made accordingly. In this context, nearly 50 court cases challenging the promotions granted at several occasions are pending at the Supreme Court, at present. A set of proposals have been made by a Committee appointed by the  Police Headquarters to study this situation and grant the relevant promotions and its first phase has been implemented by now. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development and Minister of Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare and State Minister of Defence to grant promotions to Police Constables,  female Police Constables, Police Sergeants, female Police Sergeants, Sub Inspectors of Police, female Sub Inspectors of Police, Inspectors of Police and female Inspectors of Police who had not been promoted for a long time, was approved by the Cabinet treating same as a matter of policy.",
