  "decision_details": "Presently, no legal provision exists for the applicants who submit their applications to the National Intellectual Property Office to register their trade mark or service mark to obtain international registration directly through the said office. In this respect, they have to submit applications separately  through the Intellectual Property Agents operating in each county. Under these circumstances, it has been proposed that Sri Lanka should seek access to the Madrid Protocol administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The Madrid system provides exporters with a reliable, convenient and cost effective way to protect trade marks in a series of jurisdictions.  Accordingly, \tthe proposal made by the Minister of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation, to access the Madrid Protocol by easing to submit applications internationally under the said system with a view to inducing the commercial community of Sri Lanka and to make the necessary amendments  to the National Intellectual Property Act for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
