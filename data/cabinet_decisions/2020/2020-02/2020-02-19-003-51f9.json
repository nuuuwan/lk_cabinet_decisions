  "decision_details": "- At the Cabinet meeting held on the 02nd of January 2020, it was decided that a methodology should be formulated to induce the farmers to use high quality organic fertilizer.  A Cabinet Sub Committee has been appointed to formulate  such a methodology to submit appropriate recommendations in this regard.  The Committee had pointed out that the standards relevant to the organic liquid fertilizer and bio-fertilizer should also be declared expeditiously, since the Sri Lanka Standard Institution has already declared the standards for organic fertilizer.
