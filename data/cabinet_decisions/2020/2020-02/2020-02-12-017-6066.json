In order to achieve the said target, the proposal made by the Minister of Industry and Supply Management for the implementation of a value addition export programme by starting a Public-Private Partnership project utilizing the Mineral Sand excavated by Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd., was approved by the Cabinet.",
