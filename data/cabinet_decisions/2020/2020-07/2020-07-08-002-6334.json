  "decision_details": "- Previously, the stocks of beedie leaves brought to Sri Lanka without formal approval were forfeited by the Sri Lanka Customs and were sold by public auction having followed the customs procedure. However, considering the adverse health impact caused to those who consume beedie manufactured by using such beedie leaves, the Cabinet decided to destroy the stock of beedie leaves forfeited by Sri Lanka Customs, in future.",
