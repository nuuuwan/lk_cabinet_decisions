  "decision_details": "- At the Cabinet meeting held on 30th March 2016, approval had been granted to appoint an Interim Board comprising of a Chairman and 09 members and recruit the required staff for that Board, until the Southern Development Board is legally constituted by an Act of Parliament. However, the Southern Province Development Board bill has not been tabled in Parliament up to date. Some of the projects implemented by the Interim Board have already been completed while all other remaining projects are scheduled to be completed by the year 2020. Therefore, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal made by the Minister of Industrial Export and Investment Promotion for winding up the functions of the Interim Board set up until the Southern Province Development Board Bill is passed and for obtaining the required allocations for the completion of work of the projects to be completed.",
