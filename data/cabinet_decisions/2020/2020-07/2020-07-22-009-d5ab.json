  "decision_details": "- The Moragolla Hydropower Project is being implemented under the Phase I of the Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Programme implemented by Asian Development Funds and due to delays in the implementation of the project, the loan closing date has been extended up to 2021\u201103\u201131. However, due to delays in the relevant procurement process, the project completion date and the loan closing date have to be revised further.
