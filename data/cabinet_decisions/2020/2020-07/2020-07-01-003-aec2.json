  "decision_details": "- Although the contract to procure food items to the Department of Prisons for the year 2019 / 2020 is due to be expired on 2020 07 31, it has not been able to carry out the procurement procedure for the selection of new suppliers as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic condition. Therefore, considering the present situation experienced by the country as well as the current market conditions, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal furnished by the Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Legal Reforms for awarding the contract for the purchase of food items required by the Department of Prisons to the current supplier itself from 2020 08 01 to 2021 01 31, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee.",
