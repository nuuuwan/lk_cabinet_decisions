  "decision_details": "- The Consultancy Services Contract for the construction of the Broadlands Hydropower Project has been assigned to the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau. Although, the project was scheduled to be completed on 2017 07 14, it could not be completed as expected due to public protests, delays in releasing the land, change of the equipment manufacturer and delay in executing the loan agreement. Therefore, the contract period of the existing Consultancy Service Contract with the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau is required to be extended. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Power & Energy to extend the said Consultancy Service Contract up to 2020 07 31 as recommended by the Standing Cabinet \tAppointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
