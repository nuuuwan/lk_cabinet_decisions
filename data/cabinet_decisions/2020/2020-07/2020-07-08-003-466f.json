  "decision_details": "- The Transfer of Offenders Act No.5 of 1995 contains provisions to enable a citizen of a foreign country who is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment by a court in Sri Lanka to serve his sentence in the country of which he claims to be a citizen and a Sri Lankan who is subjected to such a punishment in a foreign country to be transferred back to Sri Lanka to serve the period of imprisonment in this country. In order to give effect to these provisions, Sri Lanka should enter into an agreement with the relevant country. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the Minister of Justice, Human Rights and Law Reforms to sign an agreement between the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan so as to transfer of sentenced persons other than those who are accused and convicted for terrorist activities and drug trafficking.",
