By the August 2014, houses for displaced families due to the implementation of the hydro power project and alternative locations for shops and workshops have been constructed and handed over to the beneficiaries and the activities relating to the payment of the compensation too has been completed. However, the right to the lands of the relocated families has not been granted so far. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Power & Energy for transferring the alternative lands provided for the construction of alternative residencies and buildings and for cultivation purposes for the displaced parties due to the construction of Upper Kotmale Hydro Power Plant, to the relevant beneficiaries through free grants, was approved by the Cabinet.",
