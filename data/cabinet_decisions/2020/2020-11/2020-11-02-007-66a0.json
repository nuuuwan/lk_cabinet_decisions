  "decision_details": "- Spices and Allied Products Marketing Board has been established under the provisions of section 2 of the State Agricultural Corporations Act No 11 of 1972. At its meeting held on 2008\u201107\u201116, the Cabinet decided that the functions of the said Board be vested with the Department of Export Agriculture and the institution be closed with effect from 2008\u201107\u201127. However, the Spices and Allied Products Marketing Board currently falls under the purview of the State Ministry of Development of Minor Crops including Sugarcane, Maize, Cashew, Pepper, Cinnamon, Cloves, Betel Related Industries and Export Promotion. Since the necessity of having a formal mechanism to implement the programmes and projects identified by the said State Ministry, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation to reactivate the Spices and allied products Marketing Board and continue its activities, was approved by the cabinet.",
