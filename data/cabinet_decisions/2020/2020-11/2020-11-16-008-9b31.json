  "decision_details": "- It is apparent that there are also instances where protests, demonstrations, strikes etc. conducted by certain employees in the public sector at present,resulting impediments to achieve theNational development goals. Although it is possible to take action to minimize disputes and strikes in the private sector in terms of the provisions of the Labour Dispute Act No.43 of 1950, the Government sector possesses no such methodology. Through the Government's Policy Framework of \u2018Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour\u2019, it has been pointed out that a mechanism similar to the arbitration system adopted by the private sector to solve the employee disputes at present would be introduced to solve the employee disputes in the public sector as well. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Services, Provincial Councils and Local Government, to appoint a committee comprising of relevant Secretaries to ministries and relevant trade union representatives, in order to introduce amechanism fortified with four aspects; dialogue,consultation, mediation and arbitration which can be agreed by all in order to avoid and settle disputes in the public sector, was approved by the Cabinet.",
