  "decision_details": "- The difficulty in obtaining information on gender and age disaggregated data with the exception of a limited number of census and surveys by the Department of Census and Statistics and the surveys of the health sector has become an issue in the policy and planning process. This information is essential for identifying Government-prioritized needs, especially in the field of child and women's development, and for understanding their trends and determining plans and strategies for addressing them. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to make it compulsory to collect information based on gender and age group in all census, surveys and studies conducted by Ministries, Departments and Statutory Institutions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
