  "decision_details": "- Considering the difficulties erupted for the continuation of teaching activities in the schools due to the COVID - 19 pandemic situation, approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to use both \u201cEye Channel\u201d and \u201cNethra Channel\u201d to perform teaching activities by means of television and radio services under the distance education system. With the re-emergence of COVID - 19 pandemic in the country, it has been perceived that optimal alternative distance educational methodologies are essential to be applied for the continuation of educational activities, since re-opening of schools as scheduled seems to be not practical at present. Therefore, it has been planned to prepare and telecast television educational programmes from grades 3 to 13 in all the three languages; Sinhala, Tamil and English. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education, to implement a series of Educational prorammes with the assistance of the State and private television and radio channels in collaboration with the National Institute of Education and the State Ministry of Education Reforms, Open Universities & Distance Learning Promotion, was approved by the Cabinet.",
