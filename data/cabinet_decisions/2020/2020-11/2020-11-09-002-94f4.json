  "decision_details": "- The requirement of long-term reserving of a borrow area for offshore sand mining has been arisen for mining sand for the construction industry and as well as for the projects implemented by Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation. The institution has satisfied its sand requirement since the year 1994 by mining sand within an offshore area of 61 square kilometers, having obtained exploration license periodically. Considering the proposal made by Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development and Housing, the Cabinet decided to grant approval to permit the the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation for offshore sand mining from the said borrow area of 61 square kilo meters for a period of 10 years, subject to carrying out an Environmental Impact Assessment.",
