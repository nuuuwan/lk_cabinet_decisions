  "decision_details": "- Fertilizer Testing Laboratory of Ceylon Fertilizer Company issues certificates to the relevant institutions after testing fertilizer samples. Since the Ceylon Fertilizer Company is a commercial institute engaged in the fertilizer supply process, it seems inappropriate to engage in the regulatory function of testing samples. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture to transfer the ownership of the Fertilizer Testing Laboratory with its all movable and immovable assets to National Fertilizer Secretariat, was approved by the Cabinet.",
