  "decision_details": "- Attention has been drawn to solve the issues confronted by the traditional craft industries and rural industries in order to empower the industrialists who involved in those sectors, since such industries can have a huge impact on the economy of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it has been planned to supply the manufactures the raw materials at a concessionary basis, enabling them to price such goods in order to compete with the imported goods in the market. For the purpose, the proposal made by the Minister of Industries to obtain the empty bullet casings (Brass) and disposed armour plates used by the Sri Lanka Army, the Sri Lanka Air Force and the Sri Lanka Navy to the National Crafts Council, deviating from procurement procedure and subject to the pricing formula  approved by the Cabinet in the year 2017 and also to purchase copper, brass and aluminum etc disposed by the Sri Lanka Telecom, the Department of Sri Lanka Railways, the Ceylon Electricity Board and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board at a concessionary price to the National Crafts Council, was approved by the Cabinet.",
