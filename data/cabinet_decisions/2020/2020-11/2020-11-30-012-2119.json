  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been received on several occasions for the renovation of the National Art Gallery. Although the Cabinet at its meeting held on 2018\u201108\u201121 has granted approval to allocate Rs. 42 million for the purpose, relevant renovations have not been carried out. Main building of the Art Gallery is in a dilapidated condition due to water leaking from the main rain water pipe that was installed to drain the rainwater and it needs to be repaired immediately. Accordingly, the proposal presented by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs to obtain the services of the Sri Lanka Navy and carry out the relevant repairs of the National Art Gallery, was approved by the Cabinet.",
