  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that it would be appropriate to implement a proper programme to collect and preserve, maintain and protect ancient weapons including stone tools found in archaeological excavations, the traditional weapons used in the past which are now subject to extinct and modern weapons. Accordingly, considering the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister, approval was granted for the establishment of a separate unit for preservation of weapons within one of the most appropriate museums which is presently under the purview of the Department of National Museum.",
