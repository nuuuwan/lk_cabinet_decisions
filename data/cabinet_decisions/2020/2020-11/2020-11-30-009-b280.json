  "decision_details": "- The vehicle registration certificate, vehicle number plates and a sticker are issued when registering a vehicle. Under the existing system, one has to come to the Department of Motor Traffic spending considerable time and expense in order to obtain them. Further, there seems to be some delay in sending new driver's licenses by registered mail to clients. As a remedy for the issue, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport to implement a suitable programme in collaboration with the Postal Department enabling to deliver them to the client's home under the express courier service implemented by the Postal Department, was approved by the Cabinet.",
