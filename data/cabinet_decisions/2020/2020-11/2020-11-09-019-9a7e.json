Particularly, as per the COVID- 19 pandemic condition, it has become appropriate to make provisions for such measures to be taken deviating to the ordered time limit, when certain persons are ordered to take certain measures within specified time limits. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal submitted by the Minister of Justice to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft the COVID -19 Bill (Temporary Provisions) to impose relevant provisions including such identified matters.",
