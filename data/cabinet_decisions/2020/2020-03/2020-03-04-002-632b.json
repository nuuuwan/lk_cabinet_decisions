  "decision_details": "- Seven plots of lands in extent of about 7.5 acres, developed by the Kalutara Bodhi Trust Board, have been given over to the said Trust Board by the Land Commissioner General on three long term leases and the Trust Board has made a request to the said Department to grant another plot of land on lease basis. Since all the lands given on lease basis have been developed well and also as granting the lands requested to the Kalutara Bodhi Trust will be of great significance to the development of the 'Pooja Area' it has been found that it is appropriate to vest the said plots of land on a free grant. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Buddhasasana, Cultural and Religious Affairs, to grant the said plots of land presently given on lease basis to the Kalutara Bodhi Trust Board as a definitive grant and the remaining plots of land which have been developed and utilized presently to be given to the said Bodhi Trust on a long term lease, subject to taking them back without payment of compensation for the extent so acquired, in the event that such lands are required in the future for the development activities of the area, was approved by the Cabinet.",
