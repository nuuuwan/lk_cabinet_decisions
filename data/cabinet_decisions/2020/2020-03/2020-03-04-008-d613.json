  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet had granted approval previously, for the construction of 28,000 concrete panel cost effective permanent houses (at a cost of Rs.1,280,000/- per house) for the conflict affected families in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka and as at its initial stage to construct 7,000 calicut tile roof houses.\n\n\tNevertheless, due to the inability of securing the required funds for the project as expected, the General Treasury had taken the necessary action to get a term loan facility from the Bank of Ceylon to construct 1,000 houses initially.  Accordingly, the information submitted by the Minister of Community Empowerment and Estate Infrastructure Development, that a commercial agreement has already been signed with the contractor, M/s YAPKA Development (Pvt.) Ltd., selected for the construction of the 1,000 houses utilizing the said loan and that the activities of the relevant project has been commenced on 2020 02 21, was noted by the Cabinet.",
