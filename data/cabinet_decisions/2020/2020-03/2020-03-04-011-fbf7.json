  "decision_details": "- The Fertilizer Act, No.68 of 1988 has provided the necessary legal provision to regulate the importation, production, preparation and distribution of fertilizer. The said Act has not been subject to any amendment so far and although action has already been formulated to upgrade the Act to suite the present needs, the absence of a formal national fertilizer policy declaration up to date, is seen as a major  impediment to the progress of the said field. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development, to appoint a committee comprising of experts in the field to formulate a National Fertilizer Policy and to prepare the final draft, after obtaining the views of the other relevant stakeholders and the general public on the draft so prepared, was approved by the Cabinet.",
