  "decision_details": "- The Tertiary and Vocational Educational Commission having introduced the National Vocational Qualification Framework, maintains a nationally recognized qualification awarding system.  In order to extend the recognition  existing in this regard, the International Labour Organization with the intergration of the Employers Federation of Ceylon has planned to implement  a pilot project to introduce a 'Skills Passport' to the skilled NVQ Holders and the migrant workers. Rapidly growing industries in the fields such as construction, hospitality and domestic/care services have been selected for the first phase of this project. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Skills Development, Employment and Labour Relations to issue a 'Skills Passport' as a SMART card by the Tertiary and Vocational Educational Commission for the skilled NVQ Holders with a minimum of one year  experience, was approved by the Cabinet.",
