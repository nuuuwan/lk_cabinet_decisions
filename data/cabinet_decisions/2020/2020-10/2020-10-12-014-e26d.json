  "decision_details": "-The following issues have been identified as some of the impediments to fast track the implementation of development Activities:\n\n*\tMinistries have to take action to obtain the approval from several institutions and finally the Cabinet of Ministers for general matters which are not required as matters of policy or the regulatory requirements.\n\n*\tDelays in payments to be done to private contractors cause delays in development projects and the cost escalation of projects.\n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Finance to pursue action as follows to fast track the development activities in order to minimize the delays caused as far as possible:\n\n*\tTo submit a report to the Cabinet of Ministers once in three months on the development projects which could be implemented with the approval of the Secretary to the Treasury and the other relevant Authorities, after fulfilling the same expeditiously.\n\n*\tTo introduce a new mechanism to ensure a continuous cash flow for the key development projects by issuing Treasury Guarantee or Facilitation Letters to their banks, enabling to pay the Contractors for their work completed, without delay.",
