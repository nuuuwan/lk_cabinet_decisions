  "decision_details": "-The Colombo Flight Information Region is nearly 25 times of the total land area of Sri Lanka. The Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited is responsible for providing quality air navigational services within the Flight Information Region. Accordingly, Sri Lanka will have to maintain the services required to meet the projected capacity demands in the Asia-Pacific Region, as well as to maintain the air traffic services, aviation procedures and related infrastructure facilities in line with the standards set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization, in the future. \n\nTherefore, the existing air route structure within the Colombo Flight Information Region needs to be restructured immediately so as to suit to the present day requirements and it should be formulated in line with the \"Seamless Air Navigational Services Concept\" of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism, to fully reorganize the Colombo Flight Information Region subsequent to a study conducted in that regard, enabling to completely reorganize the Flight Information Region of Sri Lanka and to obtain the services of an integrated specialist consultancy service for the said study, was approved by the Cabinet .",
