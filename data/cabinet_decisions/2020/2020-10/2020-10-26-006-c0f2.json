Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to purchase new technical equipment including internet facilities required to modernize the examination management process of the Department of Examinations, to train the respective staff to utilize the said devices and to establish Examination Evaluation Centres at provincial level to facilitate the exam evaluation process, was approved by the cabinet.",
