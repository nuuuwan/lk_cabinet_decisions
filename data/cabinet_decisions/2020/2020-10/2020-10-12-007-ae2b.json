  "decision_details": "-There are a number of local products that can be promoted as geographical indication and such products have to face a severe competition due to counterfeits both in the local and foreign markets. Therefore, it has been identified that it is appropriate to register such products in Sri Lanka as geographical indications. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a bill to amend the Intellectual Property Act No.36 of 2003 enabling to establish a comprehensive and specific legal framework to register geographical indications in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
