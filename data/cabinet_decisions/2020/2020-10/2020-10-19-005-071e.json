  "decision_details": "-Although National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency successfully performs the regulatory activities of Medicines, Medicinal Devices and Borderline Products so far, the lack of a Laboratory with adequate facilities and modern technology to conduct quality testing is identified as an obstacle to perform its regulatory activities more effectively. Further, with the expansion of the functions of the Authority, recruiting of new staff is taking place and since existing space is in-sufficient, it is necessary to expand the present space urgently. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Health for the acquisition of 03 acres from the land in extent of 13 acres belonging to Milco Private Limited at the Kirula Grama Niladhari division of the Thimbirigasyaya Divisional Secretariat division for the National Medicines Regulatory Authority and to construct the proposed new building complex and the National Medicines Quality Assurance Laboratory for the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency within the said premises, was approved by the Cabinet.",
