  "decision_details": "- A decision had been taken in 2006, to transfer the powers vested with the Divisional Secretaries to authorize the use of the remaining non-forest lands of residual lands for activities such as chena cultivation, other farming and temporary economic activities to an Inter-Ministerial Committee. At its meeting held on 2020\u201107\u201101, Cabinet decided that it would be appropriate to introduce a simplified mechanism of granting permission to engage in such economic activities to minimize the hardships faced by those temporarily engaged in chena farming and other economic activities in such lands. Accordingly, having studied the issues, the officers of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation, Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Lands have formulated a new mechanism. As such, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Conservation, the Minister of Environment and the Minister of Lands to implement the said mechanism, was approved by the Cabinet.",
