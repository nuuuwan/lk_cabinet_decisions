  "decision_details": "- Due to the cease of the tea production activities of the Raigam Korale  Shakthi Tea Factory from April 2019 by the the Dikhena Tea Small Holder Development Society which had taken over the said tea factory on lease basis, tea smallholders who supplied their production to the said factory are faced with severe difficulties.

Taking into account the request made by the tea smallholders to restart the activities of the said factory, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation to hand over the said factory on lease basis to Raigam Tea Small Holdings Development Society, which has the financial strength and 1,800 members to carry out production activities of the Factory, was approved by the Cabinet.",
