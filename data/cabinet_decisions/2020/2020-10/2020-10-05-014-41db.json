  "decision_details": "-\tThe Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources issues special diving permits for the collection of sea creatures such as Sea Cucumber and Conch Shells in the western coast of the Jaffna peninsula. Accordingly, the diving teams engaged in such activities attend to same while residing temporarily on the coast of that area.\n\nIt has been reported that some of the divers who have obtained permits for this purpose are abusing these permits and engaging in illegal activities with the Indian fishermen who engage in fishing by trawlers in that maritime boarder. It has been observed that in view of the above, there is a severe threat of the spread of COVID- 19 pandemic among the people of Jaffna peninsula. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Fisheries, to  temporarily suspend the diving permits issued for the collection of sea creatures such as Sea Cucumber and Conch Shells, was approved by the Cabinet.",
