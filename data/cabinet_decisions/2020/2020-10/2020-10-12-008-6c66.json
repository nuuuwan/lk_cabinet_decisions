  "decision_details": "-In accordance with the provisions of the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, it is possible to import 6000 Metric tons of Basmati rice annually under duty free concession. In recent times, the private sector also had been granted permission to import Basmathi rice under this facility. However, complaints have been received with regard to various irregularities being committed by importing rice not belonging to the specified varieties. Taking into consideration these matters, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade to import Basmathi rice only through the Sri Lanka State Trading Corporation and the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment/ Lanka Sathosa ltd., under this facility, was approved by the Cabinet.",
