Considering the fact that the proposed Centre is situated about 90 km away from Colombo and the practical difficulties to be encountered by establishing the Centre in such a distant place, the proposal made by the Minister of Education, to establish the said Centre at Pitipana in the Divisional Secretariat Division of Homagama, was approved by the Cabinet.",
