  "decision_details": "- The Gazette Notification No.1940/21 dated 2015 11 12 has been published to publish the regulations on the road signs, signals, symbols and road markings, in terms of the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act. However, 'a sign to show 'a limited halting place for long distance service omnibuses' had not been introduced therein.  Taking into consideration the inconvenience caused by the bus drivers and as well as the passengers due to the non availability of such a sign, the Gazette Notification No.2128/9 dated 2019 06 18 has been published inclusive of a new sign to publish a limited halting place for long distance service omnibuses. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport Services Management to present the said Gazette Notification in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
