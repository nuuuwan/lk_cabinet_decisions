  "decision_details": "- Even though legal provisions are in existence to  admit 4.5% of foreign students out of the total number of students expected to be admitted annually to the State Universities Undergraduate Degree Programmes, it has been found that only a limited number of foreign students get registered to study in the Universities of this country.  Considering this situation, the proposal made by the Minister of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation, with the objective of making Sri Lanka an International Knowledge Hub, to initiate promotional activities for admitting foreign students on fee levying within the already allocated percentage for foreign students, to admit the children of Sri Lankan foreign employees to the State Universities on fee levying basis from foreign currency and to initiate necessary action for establishing branches of the world renowned Universities as per the World University Ratings in this country, was approved by the Cabinet as a matter of policy.",
