  "decision_details": "- The Seethawaka Export Processing Zone which commenced in the year 1999 has been handed over to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka in the year 2001. This comprises of 28 enterprises and has generated around 23,300 job opportunities. Although the capacity of the existing common wastewater treatment plant is 9,500 m3 per day, the industries therein discharge wastewater approximately 12,400 m3 per day. As the existing common wastewater treatment plant is not adequate for the treatment of wastewater discharged, it has been found that the capacity of the common wastewater treatment plant should be augmented immediately in order to avoid any adverse environmental and health issues. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Industrial Export and Investment Promotion to implement the Augmentation of the Common Wastewater Treatment Plant Project at the Seethawaka Export Processing Zone to develop the capacity to 15,000 m3 per day, was approved by the Cabinet.",
