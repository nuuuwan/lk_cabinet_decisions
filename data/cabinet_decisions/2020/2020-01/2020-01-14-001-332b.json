  "decision_details": "- The intelligence agencies in Sri Lanka make a significant contribution by predicting activities which would impact the national security, taking appropriate preventive measures and making suitable recommendations in that regard and have prevented terrorist and other threats on predictions made by such agencies, on account of information disclosed and recommendations made by them during national crises which have become vitally important to affirm the national security. \n\nIt has been observed that the activities of certain intelligence agencies are curtailed due to the absence of adequate legal provision required to regulate activities related to intelligence operations and empower the intelligence agencies and support  their operational activities.\n\nAs such, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development, Minister of Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare and the State Minister of Defence to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill empowering all fields of intelligence giving priority to the national security, was approved by the Cabinet.",
