  "decision_details": "- The Hon. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court also serves as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund which controls the administration, management and its funds. Since the Hon. Chief Justice being a member of the Board of Trustees is an impediment to take an independent decision in the case of a Court proceeding, pertaining to the said fund, the Hon. Chief Justice himself as well as  the Committee on Public Enterprises have suggested that it is appropriate to relieve the Chief Justice from the said Board of Trustees. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Higher Education, Technology and Innovation to amend the Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Trust Fund Act, No.66 of 1981 enabling the appointment of members to the said Trust Fund as appropriate, was approved by the Cabinet.",
