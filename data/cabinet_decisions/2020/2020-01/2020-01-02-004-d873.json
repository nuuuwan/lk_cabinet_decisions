  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that the pre\u2011schools could make a greater contribution towards the development of the early childhood of the children. It has also been observed that the teachers/matrons of certain pre\u2011schools are devoid of professional competency or adequate educational qualifications. In addition, it has been found that the untrained teachers of pre\u2011schools are also engaged in a teaching process not in conformity with the development of children in the age group of 3-5 years. Taking all these matters into consideration, the proposal made by the Minister of Education, to implement the National Policy on Pre\u2011School Education, prepared after obtaining the views of the experts in the field, officials and interested parties in the matter, was approved by the Cabinet.",
