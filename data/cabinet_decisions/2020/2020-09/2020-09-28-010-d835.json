In the \tyear 2016, the National Law Conference Committee complied a report on the \tvarious issues causing delays in litigation, the adverse consequences of these \tissues, and the proposed solutions for the same. By the end of 2019, there were 766,784 pending court cases in all courts of the country and expeditious solutions need to be considered to address the situation.\n\n\tIt has been identified that necessary action should be taken in the areas such as development of infrastructure, reform of the law, digitization of courts and capacity building. Accordingly, taking into consideration the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, the Cabinet granted approval to establish a Special Unit under the Ministry of Justice to implement a Law Reforms Programme within a period of 3 years with the contribution of the Legal Experts in the field of Law.",
