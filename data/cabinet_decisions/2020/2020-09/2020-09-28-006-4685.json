  "decision_details": "-As the Official Printer of the Government, the Department of Government Printing has the potential of carrying out a significant portion of the printing requirements of Government and Semi-Government institutions. However, it has been found, that these institutions pay a large sum of money annually to local and foreign private companies for their printing works. Taking into consideration the above, according to the proposal made by the Minister of Mass Media the Cabinet decided that all Government and Semi-Government Institutions which do not have printing institutions under their Ministries should take steps to get their printing work which is not exceeding 25% of the value of printing requirements, done through the Department of Government Printing.",
