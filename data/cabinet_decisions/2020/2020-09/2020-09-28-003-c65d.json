  "decision_details": "-The Project for urgent improvement in the old water treatment plant of the Kirindi Oya Water Supply Scheme had been entrusted in the year 2019 with the State Engineering Corporation by the then subject Ministry of Housing. However, this project has not yet been completed to date and its present overall progress is 40%. For the construction work, the present capacity of the old treatment plant has been reduced by 50% and consequently the community in the area is confronted with extreme difficulties due to the inability to obtain sufficient water. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development and Housing, to entrust the responsibility of implementing the Project to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board with the intention of completing the project expeditiously and to provide the allocation for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
