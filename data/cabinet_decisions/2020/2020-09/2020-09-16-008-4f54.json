  "decision_details": "- Since some words and terms appearing in the Evidence Ordinance are completely outdated in today's context, approval of the Cabinet was granted at the meeting held on 2016\u201107\u201105 to amend the Evidence Ordinance by substituting new words and terms. Accordingly, the clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft Bill formulated by the Legal Draftsman and therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter present the same in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
