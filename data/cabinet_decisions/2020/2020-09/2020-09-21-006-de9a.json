  "decision_details": "- Based on the recommendations and proposals of the disaster management professionals and also the experiences gained from the disasters that took place in the past, the Legal Draftsman is currently working on the preparation of a draft Bill to amend the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act No.13 of 2005 as per the Cabinet approval given on 2016\u201109\u201113 so as to suit to the present day requirement. In the meantime, since, it has been observed that people evicted from their places of residence due to the damages caused to houses and high risk of landslides, resettle in the same locations again, the Cabinet at its meeting held on 2019\u201102\u201126 had decided that action has to be also taken to prevent this situation. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Irrigation and State Minister of Internal Security, Home Affairs and Disaster Management to instruct the Legal Draftsman to amend the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act, No. 13 of 2005 incorporating the said provisions in the draft amendment Bill currently being prepared, was approved by the Cabinet.",
