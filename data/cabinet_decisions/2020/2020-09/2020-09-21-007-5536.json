  "decision_details": "- The housing project consisting of 400 housing units at Elliot Place, Borella is being implemented by the Urban Development Authority for the middle income earners in the Government and private sector. However, since the said project did not proceed as planned due to financial problems in the company that was awarded the contract for the design, construction and financing of the project, the contract was terminated. This project has been identified as a priority project and, National competitive bids have been called to complete the balance work of the said project. As such, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development and Housing to award the said housing construction contract to M/s Access Engineering PLC, for a sum of Rs 9.37 billion (without tax), as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
