  "decision_details": "-As a country with an economy based on agriculture, the contribution of the cattle to develop the livelihood of the rural people of Sri Lanka is immense. Various parties have pointed out that the cattle required for traditional farming purposes is insufficient due to the rise of cattle slaughter and that the lack of sufficient cattle for the improvement of the local dairy industry enabling to enhance the livelihood of the rural community while reducing the large amount of foreign exchange outflow on imported milk powder has become an obstacle for the development of that industry. Accordingly, taking into account this situation, the Cabinet granted approval to implement the following proposals submitted by the Hon. Prime Minister.\n\n\n\n\n*\tTo take necessary action, without delay, to amend the existing Animals Act No.29 of 1958, the Butchers Ordinance No.09 of 1893 and other relevant consequential laws and rules and regulations passed by the Local Authorities which are being implemented in the country at present pertaining to cattle slaughter. \n\t\n*\tTo take necessary action to import beef required for the people who consume beef and provide same at a concessionary price without delay. \n\n*\tTo implement a suitable programme regarding the aging cattle, which cannot be used for agricultural purposes effectively.\n\n*\tTo ban the cattle slaughter in the country with immediate effect, subject to taking aforesaid steps.",
