  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that most of the medical equipment installed in certain hospitals are more than 10 years old, obsolete and in their End of Life (EOL) state. Further, it has been also observed that in some hospitals there is an acute shortage of very essential additional medical equipment required for their day today functioning. Representatives of the Korea Foundation for International Health-care have conducted a feasibility study for a project of supplying new medical equipment and the Korean Economic Development Cooperation Fund has extended its willingness to provide funds under a concessionary loan scheme for a project to replace the existing obsolete and End of Life medical equipment in selected 17 hospitals with the new medical equipments. As such, the proposal made by Hon.
