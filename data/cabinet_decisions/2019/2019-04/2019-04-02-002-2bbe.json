  "decision_details": "- The Rehabilitation Centre of the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board established in the Unawatuna area of the Galle District conducts special residential treatment and rehabilitation programmes for those who are addicted to drugs and thereby, socialize the drug addicts as worthy citizens. This centre started as a Community Treatment Camp in the year 1990, is now conducted as a Residential Rehabilitation Centre effective from the year 1991. Although, it could accommodate 35 residents at a time, there are more than 50 persons at all instances, in the waiting list. Since the land in which this Centre is situated belongs to the Ministry of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine, there is no possibility of making new constructions to meet the demands for the services expected through the centre. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, to vest the land in which the Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre of the National Dangerous Drugs Control Board is located, to the said Board, was approved by the Cabinet.",
