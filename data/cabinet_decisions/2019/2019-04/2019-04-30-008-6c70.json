  "decision_details": "- The need has been identified for the expeditious refurbishment of most of the buildings in the District General Hospital in Kalutara which are nearly 50 years old, which provides patient care services to a large number of patients in the adjacent districts of Ratnapura and Galle as well.  As such, it has been planned to develop the General Hospital in the Kalutara District with the construction of a building for Common Amenities, a building for the Out-Patient Department, a building complex for Diagnostic activities, a Laundry, a building complex for Surgical Wards and Quarters for the staff with a view to providing a better quality patient care service.
