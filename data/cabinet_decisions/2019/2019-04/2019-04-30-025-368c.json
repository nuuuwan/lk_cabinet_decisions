However, the proposal made by Hon. Wajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Internal & Home Affairs and Provincial Councils & Local Government to raise the total cost estimate of the project up to Rs 190.7 million owing to the non-inclusion of the essential constructions identified while the  construction was in progress in the first cost estimate and also due to the fluctuation of prices and to secure other facilities as well, was approved by the Cabinet.",
