  "decision_details": "- The approval of the Cabinet had been granted previously to construct the Thalpitigala Reservoir Project by the China Sino Hydro Corporation Ltd., under the funds of the China EXIM Bank, at a total estimated cost of US$ 174 million. It has been assessed that a further sum of Rs.7,227 million has to be set apart as estimated earlier for the project for the relevant expenditure on taxes, environmental development, land acquisition, payment of compensation, resettlement and for the provision of infrastructure facilities.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development, to amend the total cost estimate with the inclusion of the said additional sum as well, as US$ 174 million and the local estimate as Rs.7,227 million and to set apart additional financial provision from the General Treasury within the period of 2019 to 2023, was approved by the Cabinet.",
