  "decision_details": "- The restructuring activities of the Janatha Estate Development Board and the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation which have reported a poor performance for several years, are now being carried out and the payment of salaries of the employees of these institutions have been a financial burden for the Government presently. As it will take a further considerable period of time to generate income to conduct these institutions independently after restructuring them, the proposal made by Hon.\tLakshman Kiriella, Minister of  Public Enterprise, Kandyan Heritage and Kandy Development, to provide a financial provision of Rs.113 million for the Janatha Estate Development Board and Rs.78 million for the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation for the payment of salaries and allowances of the employees of these institutions from April to June 2019, was approved by the Cabinet.",
