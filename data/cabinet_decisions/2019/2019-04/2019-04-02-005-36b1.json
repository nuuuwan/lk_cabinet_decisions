  "decision_details": "- Due to the conflict situation which existed in the Northern and Eastern areas, around 577 internally displaced families still live in 25 welfare camps. Out of these, 381 families have been identified as landless families. However, allocating state lands to resettle them has become a serious issue due to the scarcity of state lands in the Jaffna area As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement & Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development and Youth Affairs, to secure provisions for purchasing the lands from the private land owners based on the Chief Valuer's valuation in order to resettle these families was approved by the Cabinet.",
