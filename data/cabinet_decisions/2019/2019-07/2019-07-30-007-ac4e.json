  "decision_details": "- The annual sugar consumption of Sri Lanka is 670,000 metric tons and 91% of this requirement is fulfilled by importation. The amount of expenditure annually incurred for this purpose is around US$ 350 million. By the year 2020, it is expected that the domestic sugar requirement will be increased up to 700,000 metric tons and lands in extent of about 104,000 hectares have been identified in the districts of Moneragala, Batticaloa, Kilinochchi, Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, Ampara, Badulla and Polonnaruwa, enabling to meet this requirement. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation Industries, to declare Sugarcane crop also as a major plantation crop in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
