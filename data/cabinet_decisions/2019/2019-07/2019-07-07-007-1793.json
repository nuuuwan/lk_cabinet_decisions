  "decision_details": "- Although a great concern has been made by many Asiatic Countries on aquaculture and the under utilizing of fish and marine genetic resources and acquired a sound knowledge and skills in that regard, Sri Lanka has not grasped an adequate amount of knowledge or information in the field.  As such, the Sri Lanka Council of Agriculture Research Policy has planned to conduct a regional conference on underutilized fish and marine genetic resources and have a discussion on the matter with the other countries. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development, to conduct a regional workshop on Underutilized Fish and Marine Genetic Resources and their amelioration from 10th to 12th of July 2019 in Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the Asia - Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institution, was approved by the Cabinet.",
