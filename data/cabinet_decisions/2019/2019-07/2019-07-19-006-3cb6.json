  "decision_details": "- The Uniforms Ordinance No.6 of 1895 has been enacted to confine and regulate wearing of uniforms by all the civilians. However, a trend of instances for the possession of uniforms similar to the uniforms of the Armed Forces and the use of garments similar to the colour of camouflage uniforms  worn by the Armed Forces, as a fashionable style, has been observed. As this situation adversely affects the National Security very seriously, an urgent necessity has arisen to prepare the laws for the prevention of such activities, to suit the present needs. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, to Repeal and replace the Uniforms Ordinance No.6 of 1895, to introduce legal provisions to meet the present challenges and to draft a new Bill for the Uniforms Ordinance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
