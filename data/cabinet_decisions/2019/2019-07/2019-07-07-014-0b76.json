  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to obtain the services of a firm with a global practice and international experience to conduct a Forensic Audit/Investigation on selected entities regulated and supervised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, due to the huge gap between the quotations of the bids which had been submitted for the purpose, the Cabinet Appointed Consultants Procurement Committee has recommended that it would be appropriate to recall bids. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Finance, to revise the cost estimate for the forensic audit and to recall bids for selecting a suitable entity for the proposed task and also to obtain the services of the Consultants Procurement Committee previously appointed by the Cabinet for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
