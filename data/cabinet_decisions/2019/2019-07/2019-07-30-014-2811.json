  "decision_details": "- Certain words and expressions in the Penal Code enacted during the colonial times and revised at several instances do not have any relevance to the present context, after the adoption of the Republican Constitution of 1972. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms to publish the draft (Amendment) Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman to substitute such obsolete words and expressions with words and expressions suited to present trends in the Government Gazette and subsequently present it in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
