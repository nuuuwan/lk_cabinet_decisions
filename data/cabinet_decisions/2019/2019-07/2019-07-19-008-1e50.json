  "decision_details": "- In terms of the provisions of the Sri Lanka Tea Board Law No.14 of 1975, a levy of Rs.3.50 is made on every kilogram of exported tea from the registered exporters. As a result of the direct and indirect levies and the economic service charges made by now, the cost of production charges will further increase and as such, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation Industries, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to make legislation to revise the tea promotion and marketing levy as Rs.3/- per kilogram and publish same in the Government Gazette and subsequently, present it in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
