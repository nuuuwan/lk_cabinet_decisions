  "decision_details": "- Fifty one instances of work that are hazardous to the young persons under 18 years of age have been identified by the regulations made in the year 2010, under the Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act, No.47 of 1956. Nevertheless, the nature of employment, as of now, has changed significantly and as such, 77 various forms of employment have been identified where work can be hazardous to the children and hinder their physical, mental and moral development. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President, at the request of the Non Cabinet Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations, to present the proposed hazardous employment regulations of the year 2019 in Parliament and on receipt of such approval to publish them in the Government gazette, was approved by the Cabinet.",
