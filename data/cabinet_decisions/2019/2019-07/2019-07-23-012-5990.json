  "decision_details": "- The approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to implement a pilot project to grant Gratis Visas for tourists visiting Sri Lanka, from Thailand, European Union, United Kingdom, the USA, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Canada, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia, Switzerland, Cambodia with a view to attracting a more number of tourists to Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, the Cabinet decided to suspend the introduction of Gratis Visas temporarily taking into consideration the security concerns of the country that arose due to the Easter Sunday terrorist attack.\n\n\tSince, the situation of the country is back to normalcy, by now, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism Development, Wildlife and Christian Religious Affairs to conduct the pilot project for granting Gratis Visas for tourists of the said countries including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Phillippines, Russia, China, India and England, was approved by the Cabinet.",
