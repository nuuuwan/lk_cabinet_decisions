  "decision_details": "- Due to the severe increase in the incidents  of organized crime, transnational crime and serious economic and financial crime in recent times, it is very important to focus attention on the minimization or eradication of such crimes and the recovery of the proceeds of a crime. Therefore, the Government Appointed Special Presidential Task Force has developed a Policy and Legislative Frame work pertaining to the proposed Proceeds of Crime Act, and that framework sets a  policy statement for the proposed Act. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to give effect to the concepts and contents  in the policy and the legislative framework of the proposed Proceeds of Crime Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
