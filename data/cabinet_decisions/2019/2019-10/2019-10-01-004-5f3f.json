  "decision_details": "- Complications have arisen due to the fact that in terms of Section 3 of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No.1 of 2006, the date of import (and export) shall be the date of delivery of the Customs Declaration, whereas in terms of Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, the time of import shall be the time at which the ship importing such goods had actually come within the limits of the Port (and time of export shall be the time at which the goods had been shipped on board).  As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Finance to amend Section 3 of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special Provisions) Act, No.1 of 2006 to enable to keep the consistency between the provisions of the two Acts, was approved by the Cabinet.",
