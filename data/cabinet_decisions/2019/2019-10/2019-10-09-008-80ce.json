  "decision_details": "- The approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to hold the Asian Pacific Regional Symposium (EMS Symposium) of the International Express Mail Service in the year 2019, in Sri Lanka. However, since the participation of the representatives to the proposed Symposium would be adversely affected due to the terrorist attack that took place on the 29th of April, 2019, it has been decided to hold the above symposium in another country in this year. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Postal Services & Muslim Religious Affairs to keep the Cabinet informed that there is no possibility of holding the above annual Symposium in Sri Lanka in the year 2019 and for approval to hold the annual Symposium in Sri Lanka  in the year 2020, was approved by the Cabinet.",
