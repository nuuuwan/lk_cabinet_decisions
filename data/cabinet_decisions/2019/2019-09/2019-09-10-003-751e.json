  "decision_details": "- The approval of Cabinet has been granted previously to pay an additional compensation of  50% of the assessed compensation for the persons affected due to Moragahakanda - Kaluganga Project, who were permanently residing in the Naula and Laggala Divisional Secretariat Areas, taking into consideration the demands made by them indicating that valuation of the acquired properties for the project has been lessened due to the lack of development of infrastructure facilities of the area compared to the nearby areas and also due to properties of the residents in the area not being renovated by them consequent to the long time delay in commencing the construction after the declaration of the project and the uncertainty that prevailed in the implementation of same.  The proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment to pay the said 50% additional compensation to the families of the Medirigiriya Divisional Secretariat Division who have not been included in the relevant Review Committee Report but subsequently determined as project affected, was approved by the Cabinet.",
