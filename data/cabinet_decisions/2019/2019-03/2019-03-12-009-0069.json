  "decision_details": "- Since the Old Yaka Bendi Ela Anicut which was used for the supply of water for irrigational purposes for the farmers in the areas of Makandura, Kandepola Koswatta and Yakdessawa had been abandoned, the farmers in those areas are faced with a severe shortage of water in both Yala and Maha seasons. As a remedy for the severe shortage of water, the new Yaka Bendi Ela Anicut Development Scheme has been designed to divert the water of Maha Oya into Ratmal Oya Basin by constructing the anicut in a new place. Simultaneously, it has been designed to construct an anicut across the Maha Oya at a length of 76.8 meters, to construct an Intake Structure across the main canal, an inter-basin canal at a length of 14.8, a tributary and distribution canals, a storage tank in Anukkampitiya across Kandepola Aru, the upper level flood protection bund at the proposed diversion anicut and to improve structures situated over the cultivation area.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development, to conduct the feasibility study and the environmental assessment necessary for the implementation of the project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
