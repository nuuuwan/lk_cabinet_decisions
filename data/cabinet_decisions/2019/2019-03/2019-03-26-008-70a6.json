  "decision_details": "- The Medical Faculty of the University of Jaffna initiated in the year 1978 enrolling 65 students as its first intake, has now expanded as a faculty with 937 students. Even though the annual enrollment of the students with multi ethnic composition had been increased by now, in line with that the infrastructure such as lecture halls, laboratories, tutorial rooms, accommodating facilities have not been developed to facilitate them. The Lyca Group of the United Kingdom has agreed to build a six storeyed building with a 6,500 Sq.M floor area including modern facilities with an investment of Rs.740 million and make the award to the Jaffna University through the Gnanam Foundation of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education to implement the relevant project and enter into Agreements, was approved by the Cabinet.",
