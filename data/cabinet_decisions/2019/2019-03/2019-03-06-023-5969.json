  "decision_details": "- It is observed that nearly 60,000 youth enter into the workforce annually, devoid of adequate vocational and technical skills and remain either unemployed or engaged in less paid jobs. It is also felt that there is a difficulty in attracting the youth for the Technical and Vocational Education and the Training Sectors. As such, an expeditious programme is necessary to be implemented to attract the youth with skills and talents required to create a labour market. In this respect, a special programme has been planned to be implemented and accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister and the Minister of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement & Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training & Skills Development and Youth Affairs, to set apart funds for this purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
