  "decision_details": "- An Agreement has been reached between the Trade Unions and the Regional Plantation Companies to increase the daily wage of the estate workers up to Rs.750/-. Nevertheless, there is a discontent in the plantation sector to the effect that the increase is inadequate and having considered the representations made in that regard, the proposal made by Hon.Navin Dissanayake, the Minister of Plantation Industries to secure the funds necessary to grant a further allowance of Rs.50/- in addition to the payment of a daily wage as agreed upon presently, to the estate workers of the Regional Plantation Companies, was approved by the Cabinet.",
