  "decision_details": "- Focus of the Government has been made on enhancing the facilities in the courts, due to the increase in the flow of court cases and the lack of adequate space and other facilities in the buildings used for the purpose. In this respect, it has been planned for the construction of the Walapane District and Magistrate's Court Building, the expansion of the Circuit Court Building in Narammala, the construction of the Vakare and Helboda Circuit Court Buildings, the construction of the production rooms and the record rooms of the District and Magistrate's Courts of Akkaraipattu and Pothuwil and the Magistrate's Courts of Kuliyapitiya and the construction of Official Residences for the District Judge and the Magistrate of Chillaw. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorala, Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms to carry out these development activities within the Medium Term Budgetary Framework of 2020 - 2022 with an investment of Rs.592.86 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
