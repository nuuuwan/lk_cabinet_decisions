  "decision_details": "- Although, it has been planned to generate 60% of the electricity from the renewable energy sources by the year 2030, due to the legal and policy differences existing between the Ceylon Electricity Board and the Public Utilities Commission over the development of electricity power stations, it has been observed that various problems will have to be encountered when such major electricity development projects are carried out. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Power, Energy and Business Development to amend the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No.20 of 2009 and the Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment) Act, No.31 of 2013 in order to adopt a more flexible method when electricity is purchased from Non\u2011Conventional Renewable Energy sources equal to or less than 10 MW capacity, was approved by the Cabinet.",
