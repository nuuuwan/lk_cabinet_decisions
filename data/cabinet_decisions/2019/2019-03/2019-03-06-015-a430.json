  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that although there are 20 fishery harbours in Sri Lanka none of them except the Dikowita Fishery Harbour has the adequate facilities that are required in mooring the fishing vessels of 55ft or more than 55ft in length. In a study made by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), it has been found that a considerable loss of post\u2011harvest fish occur due to the non\u2011availability of proper facilities for taking the fish\u2011catch over to the sea-shore and adequate facilities for the storage of fish and proper storage facilities in the currently used small vessels. As such, adequate facilities have to be provided for, to minimize the post\u2011harvest loss and to develop the qualitative aspect of the fish harvest. Taking these matters into consideration, it has been planned to develop the fishery harbours in Beruwala, Galle, Puranawella / Kudawella with the donor funds of the French Development Institute under the concept of the Green Harbours to meet the International standards. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development, to get the environmental and the sociological study for the development of these harbours done by the NARA, was approved by the Cabinet.",
