  "decision_details": "- The Phase II of the Anuradhapura South Integrated Water Supply Project had been designed for implementation to be beneficial to the people living in Nachchaduwa, Thalawa, Rambawa, Mihinthale, Thirappane, Kuda Nagaraya, some areas of the Anuradhapura town, Nuwaragampalatha Central and the Eastern Divisional Secretary Divisions. Nevertheless, owing to the problems which had cropped up for getting water from the reservoirs planned for the purpose, it has been proposed to implement the project in such a way as to get the required water from the Nachchaduwa Tank. Presently, it has been planned to construct a new water treatment plant with a capacity of 33,500 m3, 9 storage towers, 6 water sumps, the distribution system and a transmission line from the Nachchaduwa Tank up to Thuruwila, with an investment of Rs.16,936.06 million. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education to appoint a Procurement Committee to make the necessary evaluations, was approved by the Cabinet.",
