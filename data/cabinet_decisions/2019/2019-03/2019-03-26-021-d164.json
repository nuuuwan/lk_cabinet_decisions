  "decision_details": "- The students who are enrolled under the 13 year Guaranteed Education Programme and follow the vocational training curriculum should have the second year of their education in a selected vocational stream at an accredited Vocational Institute approved for awarding the NVQ 4 Level Certificate. It has been observed that most of such vocational training institutes are established in the main towns and certain other training institutes are situated only in a particular place and this situation has caused the children to incur an enormous expenditure on transport and accommodation. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Minister of Education, to provide a daily allowance of Rs.500/- for the students enrolled under the school programme to cover their transport and other expenditure, was approved by the Cabinet.",
