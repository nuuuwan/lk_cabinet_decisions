  "decision_details": "- Due to the prevailing drought condition, the generation of electricity to meet the demand for the power consumption of the Island, has become a challenge. Considering the possibility of saving a considerable amount of power through the thrift use of electricity, until such time that the generation of electricity returns to normal, the attention of the Government has been focused to make the public aware of the measures to be taken for the thrift consumption of electricity. As such, the proposal made by Hon.
