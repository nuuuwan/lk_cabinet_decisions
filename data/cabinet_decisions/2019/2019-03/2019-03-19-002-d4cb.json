  "decision_details": "- It has been revealed that, presently, the differently abled and the elderly community in Sri Lanka exceeds 15% of the total population. As such, the necessity of developing a programme has arisen to accord the due dignity to the Differently Abled and the Elderly and thereby making them to contribute to the development of the country without being dependent on another by providing the required facilities for them to meet their needs while minimizing inequalities they are subject to. Paying attention to the same, it has been proposed to implement a special programme for Empowering the Differently Abled and the Elderly Community.\n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to secure the funds necessary for the implementation of the special programme by the Presidential Secretariat to empower the Differently Abled and the Elderly Community, in collaboration and coordination with all stakeholders, focusing attention on ensuring equality in the usage of common amenities and facilities and the development of infrastructure facilities necessary, making the community aware of empowering them in the context of economic and social conditions without treating them differently within the entire community and in the fields of survey, research and policy formulation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
