  "decision_details": "-  The Report on the Public Sector Cadre for the Third Quarter of the Year 2018 has been submitted for the attention of the Cabinet. As such, it has been calculated that the approved cadre of the Public Sector as at 30th September 2018 is 1,587,803 and that the existing cadre at present, is 1,373,338. The report has pointed out the necessity of enforcing proper methodologies, laws and regulations to prevent the recruitment made by certain institutions in the Public Sector ignoring the service requirement, as several issues have emerged in obtaining optimum service from such officers and therefore, it is appropriate to make new recruitment  having obtained the concurrence of the Management Services Department only after carrying out a work study. Accordingly, the facts submitted by Hon.Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance on the data of the Report on the Public Sector Cadre for the Third Quarter of the Year 2018, were noted by the Cabinet.",
