  "decision_details": "- The Government owned building named as 'Govijana Mandiraya' situated at Rajamalwatta Avenue in Battaramulla where the Ministry of Agriculture was previously established, had been given over to the Parliament of Sri Lanka on Cabinet approval with the objective of establishing the Parliamentary Committee System.  However, as of now, the building has not been fully utilized for the purpose. Also, the Government has to incur an expenditure close upon Rs.21 million monthly as rent, as a result of the Ministry of Agriculture being established in another building on a rental basis. Nevertheless, due to the inadequate facilities available in the building both the officers serving in the Ministry and the service recipients have to be subject to various inconveniences. Taking these matters into consideration, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development, to re establish the Ministry of Agriculture and the other institutions coming under purview of the Ministry, in the 'Govijana Mandiraya', was approved by the Cabinet.",
