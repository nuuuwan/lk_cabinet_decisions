  "decision_details": "- It has been observed by HE the President that there are large numbers of unskilled employment opportunities in Government and the related agencies which are filled without paying any heed to the low income segment of the society and guided by the political patronage. Taking that matter into consideration, the proposal made by HE the President to set up a Multipurpose Development Task Force as a Government Department to provide employment for 100,000 less educated youth from low income families was approved by the Cabinet.\n\n\tFurther, it was noted by the Cabinet that it has been planned to commence the recruitment at district level in a transparent manner, to commence the operation of the Department by 15th of January 2020 and the ability of providing services of the said Task Force on a cost recovery basis to the Government, government agencies and the private sector.",
