  "decision_details": "- Due to the absence of  a National Defence College in Sri Lanka for conducting higher level courses on national defence, officers of the Tri-forces have to be directed to National Defence Colleges which conduct such courses, established in China, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. However, due to the limited number of opportunities for the courses offered by those countries annually, it has not  been possible to train the officers as expected.  In this context, approval of the Cabinet has already been granted for the establishment of a National Defence College in Sri Lanka.\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Mahaweli, Agriculture, Irrigation and Rural Development  and the State Minister of Defence to  draft a Bill for the establishment of a National  National Defence College, was approved by the Cabinet.",
