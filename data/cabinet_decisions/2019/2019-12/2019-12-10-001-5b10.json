  "decision_details": "- Under the Government Paddy Purchase Programme of 2018/2019 Maha Season, action has been taken during the recent past, to convert a part of the paddy stocks purchased, through the private sector small and medium scale paddy millers. However, since, there is an increasing trend in the price of rice these days, the steps taken to provide relief to the consumer by milling the balance of the paddy stocks of about 42,000 MT out of the paddy stocks purchased and presently remaining in the stores of the Paddy Marketing Board and to provide it to the consumer through the Lanka Sathosa Ltd. outlet network were drawn to the attention of the Cabinet by the Minister of Finance, Economy and Policy Development.\n\n\tSimilarly, taking into consideration the consent given by the major rice mill owners to supply rice within the period of next 2 - 3 months to the market without a scarcity and also to maintain the maximum retail price of rice as Rs.98/- per kg., it was decided by the Cabinet to fix the maximum price of rice as Rs.98/- per kg.  \n\n\tFurther, it was also decided by the Cabinet to grant approval to take necessary action for the importation of wheat flour until the crop harvest of the Maha season is had, to enable the people specially living in the estate and urban areas to obtain wheat flour and the products associated with it, at low prices, during the festive season.",
