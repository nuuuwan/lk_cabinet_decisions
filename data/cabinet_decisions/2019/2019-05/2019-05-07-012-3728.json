  "decision_details": "- Although the National Film Corporation, since its inception, had not intervened in setting up liquor shops in cinema theatres, with the passage of time, the Department of Excise has expected a letter with recommendations of the said corporation for the continuation of liquor shops in the cinema theatres. Setting up of liquor shops within the premises of cinema theaters expected to raise the number of viewers arriving at cinemas, it has been observed that, consumption of liquor and smoke by certain persons within cinema theaters, have caused inconveniences to the viewers, resulting in a drastic reduction of the  number of viewers arriving at cinema theaters. Therefore, as a step taken to create a qualitative cinema culture, and also with a view to contributing to the national programme for creating a drug free country, the facts presented by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, Minister of Housing, Construction and Cultural Affairs, to the effect that, the issuance of recommendation letters for liquor licenses in Cinema Theatres by the National Film Corporation would be suspended hereafter, were noted by the Cabinet.",
