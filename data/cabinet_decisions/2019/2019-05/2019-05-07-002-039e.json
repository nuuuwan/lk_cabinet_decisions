  "decision_details": "- Although the recent economic performance of Sri Lanka stands on a considerable level, to be a middle income country, the entrepreneur sector of Sri Lanka should generate better employment opportunities and contribute to the overall economic development of the country by adopting innovative technology, enhancing productivity and gaining access to the global value addition process and the new markets. As such, it has been proposed to establish the National Innovation Agency (NIA) to maintain the required coordination for the innovative, research and entrepreneurship development.
