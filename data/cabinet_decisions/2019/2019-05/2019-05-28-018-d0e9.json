  "decision_details": "- The judicial services pertaining to the police stations of  Walapane, Theripeha, Ragala, Udupussellawa, Maturata, Mandaramnuwara and Hanguranketha are provided by the District/Magistrate's Courts in Walapane. However, severe inconvenience has to be faced due to the limited space available there in the building used for the purpose. As such, it has been planned to construct a new building for the District/Magistrate's Courts in Walapane in the Court premises  itself with an investment of Rs.212.3 million. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorala, the Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms, to award the consultancy services contract to the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB), was approved by the Cabinet.",
