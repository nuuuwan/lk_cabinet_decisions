  "decision_details": "- The Open Government Partnership is a multi-party initiative aimed at ensuring great dedication displayed by the Governments for the promotion of transparency, empowerment of citizens, fight against corruption and  the usage of new technologies for the efficient performance of the Public Administration.  The motive expected in this regard, is to prepare a 02-year Annual National Action Plan inclusive of the Bondages prepared independently by all the participant countries of the Open Government Partnership.  The approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously for the implementation of the first 02 year Open Annual National Action Plan of the Government of Sri Lanka (2016 - 2018). The approval of the Cabinet has also been granted for the implementation of the second Action Plan scheduled to be implemented from the year 2018 onwards during the period from 2018-10-31 to 2020-09-30 with the collaboration of the relevant Government Institutions.  As the time period to commence the implementation had lapsed by then, H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, brought to the notice of the Cabinet that the implementation time line of the said Action Plan has been revised to be operative from 2019-03-01 to 2021-08-31 in order to be in line with the next time cycle.",
