  "decision_details": "- Improper disposal of Polythene which is generated as a solid waste of urban settings without  recycling and improper disposal of same to the environment  has become a major environmental and health issue. The Omega Energy Enviro Tech Institution of South Korea has invented a machine  to recycle polythene and plastics mixed with the urban wastes using pyrolysis technology. This machine generates pyrolysis oil and carbon by transferring polythene and plastic waste  enabling to use the said oil as a fuel whereas carbon dust can be used to manufacture paving blocks. The Omega Energy Enviro Tech Institution has extended its willingness to grant this machine to the Central Environmental Authority. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as  the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to install the said machine at Pethiyakanda compost yard premises at Attanagalla under the Integrated Solid Waste Management Project of Gampaha District, was approved by the Cabinet.",
