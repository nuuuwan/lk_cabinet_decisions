  "decision_details": "- While the 'Sri Lanka Tourism Strategy Plan of 2017 - 2020' is being in operation with the objective of promoting the income and the employment opportunities generated by the tourism sector, the recent terrorist attack has posed a significant challenge in the achievement of the said goals. As such,   the importance of the integrated public relationship and the short term marketing and brand communication has been recognized as a remedial measure. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. John Amarathunga, the Minister of Tourism Development, Wildlife and Christian Religious Affairs, for the implementation of a short term public relationship programme for a period of 45 days by a Global Agency which possess an experience in the field and an advertising campaign for a period of six (06) months to revive the Sri Lanka Tourism Brand, was approved by the Cabinet.",
