  "decision_details": "- The approval of the Cabinet had been granted previously for the Sri Lanka Molstar Corp Company to conduct a feasibility study on the Cocoa Development Project at Ranminithanna in Hambantota in collaboration with Bean & Company in Israel which is a Global Cocoa Production Company. Due to the practical delays which caused in obtaining approval for the purpose, it has not been able to complete the activities of the said feasibility study up to date. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister of Ports & Shipping and Southern Development, to extend the period of the feasibility study on this project by a further period of six months, was approved by the Cabinet.",
