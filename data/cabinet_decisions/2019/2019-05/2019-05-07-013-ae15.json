  "decision_details": "- The Horana Urban Housing Project has been initiated in the year 2017 by the Urban Settlement Development Authority but had not been possible to implement same due to the problems that cropped up since the land selected for the construction of the proposed houses was situated a distance away from the town limits. Therefore, it has been proposed to implement the proposed  project as a 'Shelter for All' project implemented by the National Housing Development Authority under the approval and provisions obtained for same. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing, Construction and Cultural Affairs to implement this project with a facility of a housing loan of Rs.600,000/- granted for each beneficiary at an interest rate of 6% on basis of repaying in monthly installments within 15 years and providing material assistance to the value of Rs.150,000/- under the community participation basis, was approved by the Cabinet.",
