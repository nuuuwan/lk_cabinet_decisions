  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that with the Kandy Town and the adjacent suburban towns becoming populous, the competition for admission of children to schools situated in the Kandy Educational Zone has become intense. As such, the attention of the Government has been focused to widen the scope of the opportunities for education of the children, living in that area, with the opening of a mixed school close to the town with a view to providing them with a qualitative education.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to initiate a new Trilingual Mixed National School, with 6 parallel classes for each grade, in a 10 acre block of land situated in the Peradeniya area with an investment of Rs.1,141.46 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
