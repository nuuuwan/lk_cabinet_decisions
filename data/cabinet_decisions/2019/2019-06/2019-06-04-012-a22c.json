  "decision_details": "- There are two lanes at each of the entry and exit ramps for traffic in the Ja-Ela interchange in the Colombo - Katunayake Expressway. One of the lanes is installed with a manual toll collection counter while the other is installed with an electronic toll collection counter. Presently, as a result of Ja-Ela and the area associated with it getting densely populated rapidly, the number of vehicles using the Ja-Ela interchange has increased in an unexpected manner during the busy hours of the day with a heavy traffic congestion of vehicles. Taking these matters into consideration, the approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to construct an additional lane each at the entry and exit ramp of the Ja-Ela interchange. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Highways & Road Development and Petroleum Resources Development, to award the contract for the construction of additional lanes at the entry and exist for precipitous roads with the manual toll collection counter facilities, to M/s RR Construction (Pvt.) Ltd. for a sum of Rs.285.4 million as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
