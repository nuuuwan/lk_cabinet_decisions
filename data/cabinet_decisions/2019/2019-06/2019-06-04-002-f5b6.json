  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to implement a Multi- Phase project on Climate Resilience covering the rivers of Mahaweli, Kelani, Malwathu, Ging, Nilwala, Aththanagalu, Mundeni Aru and the river basins of Kala oya, Deduru Oya, Maha Oya and Gal Oya under three phases during a period of 8-10 years in order  to mitigate the risks caused by adverse weather conditions. It has been planned to carry out the Flood Early Warning and Upper Kelani Flood Mitigation project, which is the first phase of this project, at an investment of US$ 310 million. Through this, it is expected to improve the capacity of weather and climate forecasting and early warning on disaster and to take action to reduce flood risks between Hanwella and Kaduwela in the lower Kelani basin. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance, to conduct loan negotiations for the purpose and to enter into a Financing Agreement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development which has extended its willingness to provide credit facilities required for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
