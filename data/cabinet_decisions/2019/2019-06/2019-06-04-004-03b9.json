  "decision_details": "- In order  to examine as to whether the persons who have had a relationship with HIV infected persons have been infected, they need to spend at least two days in a Drop-In-Centre where there are facilities available. The Positive Woman's Network, a non-governmental organization which is also a member of the Country Coordinating Mechanism of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Maleriya  has been involved with the said services for about a period of ten years. Presently, the institution delivers its services in a rented out house and it  has requested to provide a plot of land to continue its services.   Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine to provide a ten perch plot of land for the said institution from the premises of the Mulleriyawa base hospital, was approved by the Cabinet.",
