  "decision_details": "- The educational requirements of more than 200,000 students living associated with plantations in the Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Western, Wayamba and Southern  Provinces are fulfilled by the plantation schools. Nevertheless, the provision of a qualitative education to the students has become a problem as a result of the lack of adequate basic facilities in those schools. With a view to uplifting the standard of education of the children of the plantation workers to a high level, it has been planned to develop the schools associated with plantations and identified as having inadequate facilities by renovating the school buildings and providing them with the class room facilities, sanitary facilities, drinking water facilities and the supply of school instruments under an investment of Rs 300,000 million granted by the Government of India. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.\tAkila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of India for the said purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
