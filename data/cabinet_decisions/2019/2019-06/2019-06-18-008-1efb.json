  "decision_details": "- The coconut sector contributes to 0.6% of the Gross Domestic Products in Sri Lanka and makes a contribution of 5.2% of the total exports revenue. It has been able to get an increased export revenue from the coconut based products in the first quarter of this year in contrast to the first quarter of the previous year. The Coconut Development Authority has planned to provide its services to the manufactures, cultivators and various government institutions and to various stakeholders duly and qualitatively for the coconut based production and the exportation and the entire coconut based process. This will enable the Coconut Development Authority to provide its services more effectively, accurately and without any delay and also the customers to obtain the required services easily through the internet. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Navin Dissanayake, the Minister of Plantation Industries, to establish an Enterprise Resource Planning System for the Coconut Development Authority with an investment of Rs.40 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
