  "decision_details": "- As a result of the weaknesses found in controlling dengue through the traditional methods, the need for the use of a more efficient and environmental friendly bio diversity control method  had been identified and the Cabinet had granted approval previously for the use of the Wolbachia bacteria as a long term methodology for the prevention of the transmission of the dengue virus to be implemented under the Australian aid. As such, a sum of AUD 1.2 million is due to be provided to the National Health Development Fund by the Monash University of Australia under the World Mosquito Programme and out of which a sum of 120,000 AUD has already been provided. Accordingly, in order to expedite the implementation of this programme, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine, to enter into an Agreement to add the Colombo University College Lanka to be an implementation partner for this project to assist in the National Dengue Control Programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
