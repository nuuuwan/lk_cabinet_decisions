  "decision_details": "- The Base Hospital in Deniyaya is the only hospital in the area which provides secondary health care services and a population around 350,000 obtain health care services from this hospital. As the hospital is situated in a landslide prone area, it has been recommended to be relocated by the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau. At the same time, the physical and human resources available presently in the hospital is not adequate to provide a quality service for the beneficiaries to their expectation. As such, it has been planned to develop this hospital as a new Base Hospital with 600 beds and other modern facilities. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition & Indigenous Medicine, to acquire the proposed land of an extent of 33 acres agreed to be released to the Government by the Thalawakale Plantation Company, to establish the hospital and also to provide the other necessary facilities in that regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
