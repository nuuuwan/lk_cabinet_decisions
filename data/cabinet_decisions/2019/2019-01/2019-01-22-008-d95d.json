  "decision_details": "- Due to the Fall Armyworm menace which is rapidly spreading in the major agricultural areas of Sri Lanka from recent times, the farmers have to face an unexpected economic loss. Under the present Compulsory Insurance Scheme, an Insurance Cover is not available for cultivation losses caused by this kind of  pest calamity and therefore, the farmers have to obtain the Insurance Cover under an additional cover through the payment of a small premium. However, it is observed that, a majority of farmers who have commenced cultivation in the Maha Season of 2018/19 have not obtained this additional Insurance Cover and as such, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development, to reimburse the cultivation losses caused by the Fall Armyworm Pest under the Compulsory Cultivation Insurance Scheme and to secure the additional provision required for the purpose from the Treasury, was approved by the Cabinet.",
