  "decision_details": "- Since the timber requirement in Sri Lanka increases on an annual basis and in order to coincide with this, it has been proposed to increase the productivity of the forest plantation presently carried out for timber and establish new forest plantation. Lands in extent of 500 hectares have been identified in the Districts of Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar for the establishment of the new forest plantation. Through the implementation of this project, it is expected to generate employment opportunities at divisional level and contribute for the control of global warming by upgrading the forest layer, in addition to meeting the demand for timber. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to secure the funds required for the implementation of this project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
