  "decision_details": "- The  activities of the Jaffna Municipal Council are carried out at a building belonging to the Nallur Kovil at present instead of the Town Hall of the Jaffna Municipal Council which is not in use due to the damages caused to the building. It has been observed that people face difficulties since many sections which render much services  to the public on a daily basis are scattered in different locations. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis & Western Development, to construct the Jaffna Town Hall within the period of 2019 to 2023 at a cost of Rs.2,350 million,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
