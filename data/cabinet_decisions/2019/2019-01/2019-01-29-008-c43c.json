  "decision_details": "- Certified seed and planting materiel of paddy, other field crops and vegetables are received from 27 seed farms and the Contract Seed Production Programmes functioning under the Seed and Planting Material Development Centre. However, it has been found difficult to achieve the targets for the production of basic seeds due to the lack of proper irrigation facilities, lack of mechanization, inadequate storage facilities, poor transportation facilities and the limited essential structural facilities available in the farms for production activities. Therefore, a proposal has been made to carry out the functions such as mechanization of seed processing, establishing a combined drying and processing complex at Mahailuppallama, Ampara and Aluttarama farms, purchasing new technical equipment to select other food crop seeds for Palwehera and Bataatha farms, establishing four seed stores in Rahangala, Seethaeliya, Bataatha and Ampara farms, improving of the transportation system in Seed and Planting Material Development Centres and extending the Lak Krushi dealers' network island-wide. As such, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Agriculture, Rural Economic Affairs, Livestock Development, Irrigation and Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development, to allocate Rs.335 million required for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
