  "decision_details": "- It has been revealed that 90% of the waste accumulated in the coast and the ocean is generated on account of human activities and industries carried out on land and as a result of which, many social, economic and environmental issues have emerged. Action is being taken to obtain the 'Blue Flag' Certificate issued by the Foundation for Environmental Education of Denmark pertaining to the coastal line of Sri Lanka which is treated as an international standard for the assurance of the quality of the coastal line. In addition, it is also necessary to maintain a clean coastal line and ocean for achieving the goal of attracting 4 million of tourists to Sri Lanka by the year 2020 as the coastal and ocean related areas provide around 70% of the contribution to the in\u2011bound tourism industry while safeguarding the place secured by Sri Lanka as the world's best tourism destination. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to implement the programmes at District level for the maintenance of waterways free of waste, was approved by the Cabinet.",
