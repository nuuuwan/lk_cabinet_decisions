  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that there is a great demand for the loan schemes implemented under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme due to the  concessionary terms and conditions of such loan schemes. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance & Mass Media, to implement this programme covering the groups such as migrant workers with the anticipation of concessionary housing loans, private bus owners with the expectation of deploying luxury city buses instead of normal buses, investors who are looking forward to constructing and improving elderly care centres and three-wheeler owners willing to change over to the taxi service that have not so far been covered by the loan schemes implemented under this programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
