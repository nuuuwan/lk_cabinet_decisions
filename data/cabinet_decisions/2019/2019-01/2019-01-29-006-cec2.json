  "decision_details": "- The project for the construction of the Kandy Multimodal Transport Terminal has been identified for implementation under the Strategic Cities Development Project. The project which is to be implemented at an investment of Rs.11,700 million, is expected to contribute towards the establishment of an environmental friendly transport system that enhances the quality of life of the people in the Kandy City and its cultural heritage. However, it has been found that implementation of this project would deprive the livelihood of 820 persons including businessmen engaged in different entrepreneurial activities in the area. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis & Western Development, to pay compensation as recommended by the Entitlement Assessment Committee appointed to determine the exact compensation amounts to be paid to the persons affected by the said Project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
