  "decision_details": "- In terms of the provisions of section 45 of the Judicature Act, No.2 of 1978, the power to appoint Justices of the Peace to Judicial Zones, Districts and Divisions has been vested with the Minister in charge of the subject of Justice. Accordingly, Justices of the Peace will be appointed to serve in a judicial zone, district or division as appropriate, taking into consideration the place where such person to be appointed to the said post resides. However, taking into account the difficulties faced by Justices of the Peace in identifying their Judicial Zones due to changes that take place from time to time, the Cabinet approval had been granted previously to amend section 45 of the Judicature Act, No.2 of 1978 enabling to appoint Justices \tof the Peace for Administrative Districts in place of Judicial Zones, Districts or Divisions. As such, the proposal made by Hon.(Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorala, the Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms, to publish the draft bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter present it in Parliament, for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
