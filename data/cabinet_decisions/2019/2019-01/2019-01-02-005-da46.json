  "decision_details": "- The Galle-Deniyaya-Madampe Road traverses through the major towns of Morawaka, Deniyaya, Suriyakanda and Rakwana and it is linked with three 'A' Class Roads and ten 'B' Class Roads. Out of this, it has been proposed to develop a road extent of 53 km from Deniyaya to Rakwana.  This has been phased out to be constructed in 2 stages with an investment of US$ 51.75 million and it is expected to develop a road section of 18 km from Suriyakanda to Rakwana as its first stage and a road section of 35 km from Deniyaya to Suriyakanda as its second stage. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) has expressed its willingness to provide the required funds of US$ 40 million for the implementation of this project and accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance & Mass Media, to conduct loan negotiations in this regard and enter into a loan agreement, was approved by the Cabinet.",
