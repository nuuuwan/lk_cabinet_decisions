  "decision_details": "- It is observed that a long procedure has to be followed for the registration of Exporters under the registration process currently adopted by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board which has been introduced in 1985 for the registration of Exporters since it has be to operated by collaborating with 06 different agencies and that a period from 01 to 03 weeks is taken for the registration of exporters.  At the same time, studies have shown that a further period of 02 weeks to 04 weeks is required in addition to the period given above for enterprises which need permits or licenses for the Export activities.  In order to make the registration process convenient, the Sri Lanka Export Development Board has already taken steps to prepare a mechanism in collaboration with the institutions such as the Sri Lanka Customs and the  Department of Inland Revenue which operate similar databases with exporter details. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, to revoke the registration scheme presently adopted by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, was approved by the Cabinet.",
