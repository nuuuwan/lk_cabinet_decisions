  "decision_details": "- The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative that is aimed at securing a concrete commitment from the Governments on policies to promote transparency, empower  citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. Under the Open Government Partnership (OGP), all  the participating countries are obliged to develop an Action Plan inclusive of their voluntary commitments spanning for 02 years. Approval of the Cabinet had been granted previously for the implementation of the First 02 year Action Plan of the OGP (2016-2018) of the Government of Sri Lanka.  \n\nThe Second National Action Plan has been prepared consisting of 14 transformative commitments and 61 milestones ranging from enhancing the rights of the disabled community, promoting accountability through asset declarations and provision of improved services for disaster management. With the implementation of the Second National Action Plan, it is anticipated that it will enhance the citizens participation in the governance processes and transparency and thereby increasing the accountability of the Government towards its citizenry. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to implement the Second National Action Plan (2018-2020) in collaboration with the relevant Government Institutions and to appoint an Inter Ministerial Steering Committee to monitor the progress and to provide guidance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
