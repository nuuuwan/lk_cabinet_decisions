  "decision_details": "- In terms of the Land Development Ordinance, providing of survey plans in respect of the plots of land alienated to the public for residential, agricultural and other purposes, without formal survey plans and surveying of the plots of land for the issuance of grants and permits with clear titles to ensure clear ownership has to be carried out. Nevertheless, it has been found that a lengthy period of time is required for the purpose due to the limited availability of human and physical resources. As such, the Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval previously to implement a project by stages in order to perform this process efficiently. \n\nAccordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies, Economic Affairs, Resettlement & Rehabilitation, Northern Province Development, Vocational Training & Skills Development and Youth Affairs and Hon. Gayantha Karunathilaka, the Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms, to develop facilities required for surveying around 732,000 plots of land and issue about 696,000 grants and permits under Stage 1 of the project, implement the proposed Stage 1 of the project within a period of 03 years and to secure the funds necessary for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
