  "decision_details": "- In accordance with the decision taken to develop the 24.14 km road section of the Matara - Hakmana road, the improvements to the road have been made but due to various practical difficulties the development of the first 02 km section of the same has been delayed up to date. This road which is due to provide an easy access to the Southern Expressway which is scheduled to be opened in the year 2020, is also expected to minimize the traffic congestion in the Matara town area. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.Kabir Hashim, the Minister of Highways & Road Development and Petroleum Resources Development, to develop the first 02 km section of the Matara - Hakmana road at a cost of Rs.869 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
