  "decision_details": "- The Colombo - Ratnapura - Wellawaya - Batticaloa Road traverses through the Ratnapura town and immense delays in the traffic movements are experienced due to the traffic congestion. As a result, owing to the wastage of fuel and environmental pollution people are subject to a great pressure. In addition to the traffic congestion the road becomes impassable due to the floods which take place frequently. As a remediable measure a proposal has been made to construct a bypass road above the high flood level avoiding the town area. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Kabir Hashim, the Minister of Highways & Road Development and Petroleum Resources Development, to construct a 04 lane bypass road of 2.20 km long, from Weralupe to the Warakatota bridge and to construct 03 bridges of 900 m in length in the said bypass road, was approved by the Cabinet.",
