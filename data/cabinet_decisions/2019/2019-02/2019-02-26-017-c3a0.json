  "decision_details": "- Presently, a total of 50 families are living in a land at Usawiyawatta in Moratuwa belonging to the Government and 30 families out of which dwell in temporary houses. The remaining 20 families are living in two walk-up apartments built by a Non Governmental Organization in the year 2010. All these 50 families make use of public sanitation facilities which too are in an extremely dilapidated condition. It has been proposed to construct 30 houses in the same land for the 30 families living in the temporary houses and to upgrade the required sanitary facilities for 20 families living in the apartments with the contribution of the residents. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, Minister of Housing, Construction and Cultural Affairs to secure provisions for the implementation of this Project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
