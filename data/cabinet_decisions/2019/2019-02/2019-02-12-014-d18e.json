  "decision_details": "- Although it was proposed previously to increase the fines for violation of some major offences resulting largely in road accidents, H.E. the President taking into consideration the views expressed by various stakeholders appointed an Officials' Committee to make a study regarding the matter prior to the implementation of such proposals. The Committee has identified 10 offences which largely cause traffic accidents and also made recommendations to revise the fines for same. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, Minister of Transport & Civil Aviation, to publish the draft Bill pertaining to same in the Government Gazette and subsequently, present it in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
