  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that the tourist arrivals during the period of April to October shows a low rate compared to other months of the year. However, due to the fact that a number Buddhist festivals and cultural events such as Vesak, Poson celebrations and Esala Perahara occur during the period from May to August countrywide, it is anticipated that the Buddhist tourists in Asiatic countries such as Thailand where Buddhism is practiced can be attracted to Sri Lanka. Taking this position into consideration, it has been proposed to issue Gratis Visas for Thailand tourists for a period of six months with effect from 01st April 2019 in order to increase the number of tourist arrivals within the above mentioned period. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. John Amarathunga, the Minister of Tourism Development, Wildlife and Christian Religious Affairs to provide same facility for the tourists from the European Union, United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, Canada, United State of America, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand as well, was approved by the Cabinet.",
