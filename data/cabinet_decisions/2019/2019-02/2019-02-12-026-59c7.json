  "decision_details": "- The Government has focused its attention to provide reliefs to the small and medium scale rice millers expeditiously to overcome the difficulties faced by such rice millers due to the difficulty in payment of installments on loans they have obtained and the non\u2011availability of the Working Capital required for the production activities. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to provide funds to purchase paddy from the farmers through member rice millers of the District Co\u2011operative Societies and to introduce a loan repayment mechanism through the earnings that could be obtained by fulfilling the working capital requirements by using such funds, was approved by the Cabinet.",
