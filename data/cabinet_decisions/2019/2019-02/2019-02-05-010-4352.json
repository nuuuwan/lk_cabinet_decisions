  "decision_details": "- The Kolonnawa drainage basin comes under the flood threat annually due to the urbanization that occurred during the last four decades and the absence of an insufficient drainage system in the area. This has become a negative factor  to the future investment planning and for the improvement of infrastructure facilities and economic development. Therefore, measures should be taken to develop Kittampahuwa, Salalihini Mawatha and Danduthota Canals which directly connect to the Kelani river and control the unauthorized constructions and encroachments. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis & Western Development to implement the Kolonnawa Strom Water Drainage and Environment Improvement Project during the period from 2019 to 2022, was approved by the Cabinet.",
