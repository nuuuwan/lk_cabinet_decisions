  "decision_details": "- In recent times, an increase in landslides has been identified and these landslides have resulted in a significant loss of life and damages to properties and has placed obstacles to achieving both economic and social well being. Although, even by now, certain short term strategies have been adopted for the prevention of landslides, it has been planned to implement a project with permanent preventive methodologies to minimize the landslide vulnerability. It is expected to cover 27 critical landslide sites under Phase I and 120 priority sites including 20 sites situated along the upcountry railway line under Phase II. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance & Mass Media, to secure funds for the implementation of the project with an investment of US$110 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
