  "decision_details": "- Due to the limited space available in the urban and semi-urban areas, it has been found that the people residing in houses, state buildings and business places constantly affected by the air pollutants face serious health issues. Therefore, it is important to take necessary measures to control the emissions of buildings in order to overcome this situation and to increase the quality of atmosphere. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to implement the three year pilot project during the period from 2019-2021 to minimize the impact caused to the health by air pollutants, was approved by the Cabinet.",
