  "decision_details": "- Education institutes conducting foreign degree courses affiliated to the foreign universities / degree awarding institutes, are functioning in Sri Lanka and these courses are followed by local students as well as foreign students. Even though, the accreditation and quality assurance of these courses are carried out by the main universities / degree awarding institutions, no regulatory measure is adopted to find out weather these institutions are suitable for conducting such degree courses in the country. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning, Water Supply and Higher Education to introduce a methodology for registration and regulation of education institutes in the country awarding foreign degrees affiliated to foreign universities / degree awarding institutions within the ranking of the first 500 places in accordance with the international standards, was approved by the Cabinet.",
