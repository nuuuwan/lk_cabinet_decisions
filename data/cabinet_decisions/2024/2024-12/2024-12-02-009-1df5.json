  "decision_details": "- Taking into consideration the high cost of maintenance and fuel in the use of certain luxury vehicles used in Government institutions, it has been found that disposal of such luxury vehicles is more economically effective. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to carry out a formal study on the existing vehicles in all Government institutions, to dispose the vehicles with petrol engine capacity above 1800cc and diesel engine capacity above 2300cc (except Double Cabs/ Single Cabs/ Vans/Buses) that fall under HS Heading No. 87.03, by the relevant Chief Accounting Officer before 2025 03 01, following the proper procurement procedure and to authorize the Secretary to the Treasury to issue the relevant Circular instructions in order to report the Comptroller General of the General Treasury by pursuing action accordingly, was approved by the Cabinet.",
