  "decision_details": "- The provisions of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No.36 of 2024 have come into force from 2024\u201106\u201127. Various parties have pointed out that the provisions of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, the proposed institutions and their duties and responsibilities would not serve the objectives intended by the said Act, and therefore, an additional burden will be charged on the electricity industry and consumers in establishing a secure and clean electricity sector. Therefore, it has become essential to reconsider the objectives of the Electricity Act, taking into account the views of all relevant stakeholders interested in establishing a sustainable and secure electricity sector. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Energy to appoint a Committee comprising of key stakeholders, policy experts in the electricity and energy sector to study the Electricity Act, No.36 of 2024 and make recommendations for appropriate amendments, was approved by the Cabinet.",
