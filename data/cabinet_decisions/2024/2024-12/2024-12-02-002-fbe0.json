  "decision_details": "- Since foreign loan disbursements for certain projects which were implemented through foreign debt financing have been temporarily suspended due to the recent economic crisis in the country, the provisions allocated under the foreign debt financing could not be fully utilized. Further, the expenses incurred under domestic financing have also been increased significantly due to the significant increase of prices in raw materials. As a result, a problematic situation has arisen due to the inadequacy of the provisions currently allocated to settle the bills submitted by the contractors. Considering the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation in this regard, it was decided to grant the approval of the Cabinet to present a supplementary estimate in Parliament to secure required additional provisions under local financing, in lieu of the savings in the provisions allocated under foreign debt financing for the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation for the year 2024.",
