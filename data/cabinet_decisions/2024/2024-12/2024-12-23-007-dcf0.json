  "decision_details": "- The Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government has implemented a programme to evaluate the performance of all Local Authorities, in order to introduce a systematic procedure for minimizing the burden caused to the General Treasury by strengthening the sources of self- generating income of such Authorities. Under this, a program has been implemented to evaluate the performance of all Local Authorities in the years 2022 and 2023, covering the areas of management, delivery of services, governance practices and the contributions made to achieving sustainable development goals.  It has been observed during the said performance evaluation, in particular, that the quantity and quality of services provided to the public by the Pradeshiya Sabhas fluctuate due to disparities occurred depending on the areas concerned. Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, to implement a project of providing capital grants to selected Pradeshiya Sabhas for the implementation of income generating projects during the years 2025-2027, as a Medium Term Sustainable Programme, based on the strengths and weaknesses identified in the said evaluation, and under that, to provide capital grants to identified 54 Pradeshiya Sabhas viz. 06 from each province, in the year 2025, to implement those projects.",
