  "decision_details": "- Procurements for goods and services for the Sri Lanka Transport Board such as purchase of spare parts and accessories, new tyre kits, selection of institutions for the supply of reconditioned tyres for regional depots, procurement of grease and lubricants and for the procurement of new engine kits have to be carried out for the year 2025. Since four (04) of those procurements exceed the authority limit of the Ministry Procurement Committee, the said procurements have to be referred to the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to execute the said procurements separately through the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and to appoint four (04) separate Technical Evaluation Committees for the said four (4) procuments to assist the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
