  "decision_details": "- Salt production in Sri Lanka is sufficient to meet the household and industrial demand of the country and the salt harvest depends on weather conditions. It has been observed that there might be a shortage of salt supply  in the domestic market for household and industrial needs, in the first quarter of 2025, owing to the prevailed inclement weather in the country. As a remedy, the salt manufacturers have requested permission to import up to a maximum of 30,000 metric tons of raw non-iodized salt at the prevailing tariff rate for processing and supply to the market. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development and the Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development to import raw non-iodized salt, subject to a maximum of 30,000 metric tons, by the Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation Ltd., on or before 2025\u201101\u201131 and supply the same to the market through local salt manufacturers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
