  "decision_details": "- The Government has been entrusted with the main functions of providing essential public services and national security, maintaining law and order, various regulatory functions,  intervening in instances of market failures to duly provide good and services,  reasonable distribution of resources, disaster management and social welfare etc. The Security Forces and the Police aside, there are 86 Departments, 25 District Secretariats and 339 Divisional Secretariats, 340 State Owned Enterprises and 115 Non-commercial Public Statutory Institutions that perform the said duties at present. Approximately Rs. 140 billion has been allocated through the National Budget in the year 2024 for 115 Non-commercial Public Statutory Institutions coming under the supervision of the Department of National Budget and for 51 institutions falling under the supervision of the Department of Public Enterprises. Due to factors such as the failure of those institutions to adjust to suit the present requirements, inadequacy or misfit of the authority assigned, the functions assigned to such institutions being performed more efficiently by the private sector, and the existence of several institutions performing the same or similar functions, it has become a timely requirement to conduct a review on Non\u2011commercial State-owned Entities. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to appoint an Officials' Committee chaired by the Secretary to the Prime Minister to carry out such a review and submit a Report with recommendations, was approved by the Cabinet.",
