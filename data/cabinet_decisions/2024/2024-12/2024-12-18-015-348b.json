  "decision_details": "- At the Cabinet meeting held on 2024\u201103\u201125, it was decided to repeal the Special Commodity Levy Act, No.48 of 2007, where provisions have made for the importation of 64 goods including essential food items under the Special Commodity Levy executed as a single composite levy. However, it has been observed that it is appropriate to further continue with the Special Commodity Levy Act, No.48 of 2007, taking into account the likely enforcement of other taxes including Value Added Tax with the repealing of the said Act, on the goods on which the Special Commodity Levy was applicable and the consequent increase of market price of essential goods, and the likely adverse impact on the government policy on facilitating the local farmers. As such, the proposal made by the Hon. President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, not to implement the Cabinet decision dated 2024\u201103\u201125 to repeal the relevant Tax and to continue to enforce the Special Commodity Levy component on goods falling under the Special Commodity Levy Act, No.48 of 2007, with effect from 2025\u201101\u201101, was approved by the Cabinet.",
