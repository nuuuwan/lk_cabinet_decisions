  "decision_details": "- The Colombo Port operates 4 container terminals as 2 private and 2 government owned terminals, and each terminal clears around 5,000-10,000 containers per day, including the clearance of transshipments. Custom Officers determine the containers required to be inspected at the exit gates and physically scan them. Due to various problems that arose during the clearance process in the past, Custom Officers have been inspecting a larger number of containers daily and an increase in the number of ships arriving at the port has also been observed. The Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Hon. President to appoint a Committee chaired by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to take necessary action to implement an appropriate mechanism for the release of containers from the port without any delay, by further improving the efficiency of the current methodology adopted for the clearance of containers.",
