  "decision_details": "- The Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of India have entered into an Agreement in the year 2013 for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. Since Sri Lanka and India are members of the Inclusive Framework of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project, they are committed to implementing the minimum standards of the Group of 20 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Accordingly, the need to revise the Agreement signed in 2013 for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, has been identified. The concurrence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism and the clearance of the Attorney General have been received for the revised protocol which has been prepared with the necessary amendments. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, to sign the revised protocol and to submit the signed protocol, in terms of section 75(1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No.24 of 2017, to Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
