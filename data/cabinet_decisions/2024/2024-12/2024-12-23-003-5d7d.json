  "decision_details": "- The Agreement on Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) had been adopted on 2023-06-19 by the Intergovernmental Conference on the Marine Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction. This is the third Agreement implemented under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Increasing human activities in developed countries has become a threat to the marine biodiversity, thereby jeopardizing the quality and resilience of the oceans. The need to enter into the said Agreement has been identified based on the matters such as better implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the protection and conservation of vast geographical areas through better cooperation and coordination of various stakeholders. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism to sign the Agreement on Biodiversity in Areas Beyond National Juridiction, was approved by the Cabinet.",
