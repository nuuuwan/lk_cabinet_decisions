  "decision_details": "- The \u201cWater Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project\u201d has been initiated to increase the access to pipe-borne water services and improve sanitation facilities, focusing 540 Grama Niladhari Divisions in 07 Districts viz. Mullativu, Kilinochchi, Badulla, Monaragala, Rathnapura, Kegalle and NuwaraEliya. For this purpose, a credit amount of USD 165 million has been granted by the International Development Association under the Investment Project Financing Instrument of the World Bank. An additional financing component (second phase) has been approved to expand the scope of the Project, under which the Projects on extension of existing pipelines have been identified and implemented in Matara, Kurunegala, Matale and Gampaha Districts as well. Despite the planning of the Projects to be completed by 2025-06-30, the total cost estimate of the Project has to be increased by Rs. 1,180 million due to the reasons such as price increase in construction materials and the revision of Value Added Tax (VAT). Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Housing to revise the total cost estimate of the Project and allocate necessary additional provisions through the Budget Estimates in year the 2025, was approved by the Cabinet.",
