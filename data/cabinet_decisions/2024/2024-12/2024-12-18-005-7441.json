  "decision_details": "- Although Rs. 100 million has been allocated for both the years 2023 and 2024 for the acquisition of cattle with high genetic potential, it has not been possible yet to procure the required cattle due to problems that have arisen in following the relevant procurement process. Therefore, information has been sought from several countries regarding the possibility of purchasing suitable cattle as a direct                 Government-to-Government arrangement and the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan, with the mediation of the High Commission of Pakistan, has agreed to supply 07 semen donor stud bulls of Sahiwal and Nili-Ravi breeds to the country. Similarly, it has been decided that it is appropriate to purchase 20,000 doses of Sahiwal bull semen from the National Dairy Development Board of India as a Government-to-Government arrangement until the stud bulls are imported and the bull semen is produced. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to purchase five (05) Sahiwal stud bulls and two (02) Nili-Ravi stud bulls as a transaction between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of Pakistan and to purchase 20,000 doses of Sahiwal bull semen from the National Dairy Development Board of India as a Government-to-Government arrangement, was approved by the Cabinet.",
