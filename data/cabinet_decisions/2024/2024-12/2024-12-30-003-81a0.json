  "decision_details": "- In accordance with section 44(3) of the Public Finance Management Act, No.44 of 2024, there shall be a Committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers comprising of not more than eleven (11) members from the Heads of entities responsible for planning, resource mobilizing, budgeting, financing and monitoring relating to taking expeditious strategic decisions on the implementation of public investment projects, based on the information provided by the Chief Accounting Officers and the Accounting Officers. It is observed that it has not been possible to move towards the targeted development due to the failure to achieve the anticipated results and the benefits commensurate with the cost incurred from public capital investment in the past decade. Therefore, the Approval of the Cabinet has been granted to the proposal made by the Hon. President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, to establish a ''Public Investment Monitoring and Evaluation Committee'' consisting of 11 members, including two Secretaries to the Ministries and a Senior Additional Secretary to the President, to be appointed by the Secretary to the President, enabling to overcome various problems affecting the implementation of the development projects/programmes and to suggest measures to be taken in relation to project management and monitoring.",
