  "decision_details": "- There are 50 government bungalows under the administrative authority of the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, in Colombo 07 and 05. These bungalows have been allocated for former Presidents, Ministers, Deputy Ministers and various government institutions. Similarly, President\u2019s Houses are located in Colombo, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Mahiyanganaya, Anuradhapura, Kataragama, Jaffna, Embilipitiya and Benthota, under the administrative authority of the Presidential Secretariat. However, President\u2019s Houses, except for those in Colombo and Kandy, have not been used frequently. In addition, Visumpaya, located in Colombo 02, which has been used as the Official Residence of many Heads of State, is currently under the administrative authority of the Urban Development Authority. Similarly, there is an Official Residence of the Prime Minister in Nuwara Eliya under the administrative authority of the Prime Minister's Office. A large sum of money has been spent on the maintenance of the said government properties, irrespective of the fact that the said properties have been underutilized. Therefore, the joint proposal made by the Hon. President and the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government to appoint an Officials' Committee to propose an appropriate methodology, enabling to utilize the said premises and residences more productively to gain economic benefits, was approved by the Cabinet.",
