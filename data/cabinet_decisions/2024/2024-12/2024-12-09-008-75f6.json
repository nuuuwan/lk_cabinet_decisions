Accordingly, the Cabinet decided to take necessary action to introduce a new digital driving license expeditiously in place of the driving license being used at present and to continue to implement the methodology currently being adopted for the issuance of driving licenses, taking into consideration the proposals made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation.",
