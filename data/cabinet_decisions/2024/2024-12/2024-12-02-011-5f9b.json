  "decision_details": "- The Aswesuma Welfare Benefits Scheme has been implemented from 2023 07 01 and has been re-amended by the Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 2384/30 and implemented from 2024 07 01. Under this Scheme, the Aswesuma welfare beneficiary families are entitled to benefits under 04 categories. As the impact of the economic crisis has not fully subsided, it has been found necessary to provide short-term relief to the families selected in the first round in relation to the transitional and vulnerable categories and the families selected in relation to the applications of second round where the selection process has been commenced. Further, concerns have been raised to the effect that the amount granted at present is not adequate, considering the current cost of living. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, to amend the Aswesuma Welfare Benefits Scheme currently in force as follows, was approved by the Cabinet.\n* To increase the monthly benefit allowance currently granted to poor and extremely poor categories from Rs.8,500/- to Rs.10,000/- and from Rs.15,000/- to Rs.17,500/- respectively and implement the Aswesuma Welfare Benefits Scheme revised accordingly from the date on which the said Scheme is approved by Parliament.\n* To extend the benefit payment period for transitional social category until 2025 03 31.\n* To extend the benefit payment period for vulnerable social category until 2025 12 31",
