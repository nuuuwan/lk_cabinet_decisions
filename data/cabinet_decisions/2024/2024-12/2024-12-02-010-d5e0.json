  "decision_details": "- Considering the fact that Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a significant setback not only economically but also politically, socially, spiritually and environmentally, a programme named \"Clean Sri Lanka\" has been planned to be implemented as a national mission to achieve the national aspiration by ensuring the well-being, reconciliation and progress of the people of this country. This transformative initiative, guided by the new Government's vision of \"A Thriving Nation, a Beautiful Life\", will be implemented with the aim of achieving social, environmental and ethical awakening. The proposal made by the Hon. President to implement this programme through the Presidential Secretariat, establish a Presidential Task Force for this purpose, and establish a fund called the \"Clean Sri Lanka Fund\" under the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, which will be managed by a Board of Governors, to provide the necessary funds for the implementation of the programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
