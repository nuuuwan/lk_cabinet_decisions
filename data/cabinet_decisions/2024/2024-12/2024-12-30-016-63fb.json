  "decision_details": "- Currently, a large number of complaints regarding the Public Service are being received daily by the Presidential Secretariat, the Prime Minister's Office as well as Public Representatives both nominally and anonymously. It is necessary to carry out impartial and scientific investigations into such complaints in order to assure the public trust extended to the Government and in particular, to make desired positive changes in the Public Service. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to establish Investigation Units at Ministerial level, headed by a Grade I Officer of an All Island Service or an Executive Officer in Grade I in the Public Service with experience in the investigation process, to investigate into the manner in which Public Institutions have operated under the previous Governments as well as public complaints, comments and information reported from various sources regarding the functioning of the current Public Institutions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
