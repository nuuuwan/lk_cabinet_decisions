  "decision_details": "- The National Secretariat for Early Childhood Development implements a programme from the year 2017 under the technical guidance of the Ministry of Health, to provide morning meal for children in Early Childhood Development Centres/Pre-schools where there is a high percentage of underweight children. As at present, each child is granted Rs.60/- per day and it is expected to extend the benefits for about 155,000 children in the year 2025. As the current daily allocation of Rs.60/- in insufficient due to the increase of prices of food items, the proposal made by the Minister of Women and Child Affairs to increase the sum of Rs.60/- allocated for each child per day up to Rs.100/- and to implement the said programme in future in Early Childhood Development Centres/Pre-schools to be selected based on the criteria of \"Pre\u2011schools with high percentage of underweight children\", was approved by the Cabinet.",
