  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet, at its meeting held on 2023\u201108\u201114, has decided to implement a Pledge Loan Scheme for Small and Medium Scale (SME) Paddy Millers through State Banks at a concessionary interest rate with the objective of ensuring a reasonable price for paddy harvest and strengthening SME Paddy Millers. Since it has been observed that this programme has achieved high progress in the previous seasons, it has been identified that it is desirable to implement the said programme in every season from the Maha Season \u2011 2024/25. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to implement a Pledge Loan Scheme up to a maximum of Rs. 50 million for the SME Paddy Millers (including Co-operative Societies operating paddy mills) with a maximum daily milling capacity of 25 MT, through the State and Private Banks under a concessionary interest rate, subject to a few specific criteria, was approved by the Cabinet.",
