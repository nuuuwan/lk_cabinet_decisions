  "decision_details": "- Due to the relatively low requirement of metal stones for construction and development activities in the country at present, the livelihoods of the miners engaged in the metal mining industry and the community associated with it have been severely affected. Taking that situation into consideration, it has been identified the appropriateness of implementing a short-term programme to earn foreign exchange for Sri Lanka through the export of metal stones subject to restrictive conditions. A stock of metal stones removed during the construction of Hambantota Magampura Port is currently remain heaped near the Administrative Building of the Port and in the Hambantota New Hospital premises and the said metal stock needs to be removed immediately. Considering a proposal made by the Minister of Environment, the Cabinet decided to grant approval to take the necessary steps for the immediate export of the said metal stocks under the supervision of the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, and appoint a Committee to examine the matters on the possibility and appropriateness of exporting up to one million metric tons of metal stones and submit a report with recommendations.",
