  "decision_details": "- In order to further develop the existing diplomatic relations between Kazakhstan and Sri Lanka, it has been recognized that it is appropriate to establish a Sri Lankan Embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan. The establishment of the  Secretariat of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Kazakhstan and Sri Lanka being a member of that Conference provide Sri Lanka a great opportunity to engage with the Central Asian Region. Also, since there it indicates a significant increase in tourist arrivals from Kazakhstan to Sri Lanka, the establishment of an embassy of Sri Lanka in Astana will help to further promote tourism and cultural cooperation between the two countries. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to establish the proposed Sri Lankan Embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, was approved by the Cabinet.",
