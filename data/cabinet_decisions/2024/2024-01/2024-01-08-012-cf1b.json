  "decision_details": "- The Government had planned, through the Budget Proposals of the year 2024, to increase the Cost of Living Allowance of the government employees by Rs. 10,000/- from the month of January 2024 and to grant the said allowance from April 2024. Owing to the current difficult economic situation, various parties have requested to grant at least a part of that allowance within the first couple of months of the year. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to grant 50% of the increased Cost of Living Allowance viz. Rs. 5000/- to all government employees from the month of January 2024 and to increase some allowances paid to the Medical Officers and University Lectures, taking into account the pressure created by the economic situation prevailing in the country, was approved by the Cabinet.",
