  "decision_details": "- The Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is leading the global initiatives on ocean health at present. Accordingly, special attention has been given to establish a Euro 500 million 'Blue Planet Fund' and provide necessary funds from that to the partner countries in order to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030 and to achieve marine protection and sustainable blue economy. The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the United Kingdom has planned a range of programmes at bilateral and multilateral level to deliver the outcomes of the \"Blue Planet Fund\". Sri Lanka has been identified as a potential recipient country for assistance under the Ocean Country Partnership Programme which is one of programmes out of that. Accordingly, it has been proposed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding among the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the support of the Ocean Country Partnership Programme. The views have been obtained from other relevant Ministries and the Department of External Resources for the draft MoU for that purpose. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Environment to sign the said MoU, was approved by the Cabinet.",
