  "decision_details": "- Approval has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2020-10-26 to implement a project to enhance electricity generation by installing 06 additional turbines by spending 47 million US Dollars under Asian Development Bank funds to operate a wind power plant in Mannar Island. However, it is not possible to utilize Asian Development Bank funds until the government's foreign debt restructuring programme is implemented. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to implement the said project by private sector investors who will be selected on competitive basis under the Build, Own and Operate (BOO) basis with an operational period of 20 years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
