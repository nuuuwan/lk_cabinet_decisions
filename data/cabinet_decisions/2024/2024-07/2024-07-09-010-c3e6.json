  "decision_details": "- The  procedures,  operations  and  other  requirements  relating  to  companies  operating  in  Sri  Lanka  are  indicated  under  the  Companies  Act  No.  7  of  2007  and  the  number  of  companies  incorporated  or  registered  under  the  said  Act  is  approximately  199,484  as  at  2024\u201103\u201131.  Since  there  are  no  provisions  in  the  existing  Act  to  identify  the  active  number  of  companies  out  of  the  companies  which  are  currently  incorporated  or  registered  under  the  said  Act,  it  has  been  identified  that  it  is  appropriate  to  enact  a  new  law  for  that  purpose.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Minister  of  Industries  to  introduce  a  new  law  to  provide  for  re-registration  of  Companies  incorporated  or  registered  under  the  Companies  Act  No.  7  of  2007  and  to  instruct  the  Legal  Draftsman  to  prepare  a  Bill  based  on  the  Concept  Paper  prepared  for  the  same,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
