  "decision_details": "- The Criminal Procedure Amendment Act, No.25 of 2024 has been passed in Parliament on 2024\u201105\u201131 in order to provide for Judges to take into account the time spent by an accused in custody prior to his conviction as a part of his sentence for the offense for which he is convicted. However, since the above Bill does not apply to persons convicted prior to the passage of the said amendment Act, it has been identified that a mechanism to take into account the time spent in custody prior to their conviction or pending determination of the appeal is needed. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minster of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to introduce a special provisions law to execute the powers vested with the President under Article 34 of the Constitution so as to take necessary action with regard to the said convicted persons as well, was approved by the Cabinet.",
