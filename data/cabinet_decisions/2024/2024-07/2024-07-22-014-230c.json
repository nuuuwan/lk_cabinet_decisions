The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue should give his decision in that regard not later than 02 years. Any taxpayer aggrieved by the said decision too can submit an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission to review the said decision, and the decision of the Tax Appeals Commission must be given within 270 days from the date of receipt of such review request. Accordingly, the said appeal process may take almost three years whereby approximately 73 billion rupees of tax could not be charged to the government revenue during the past. Taking into account the said matters, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to introduce appropriate amendments to the Inland Revenue Act, No. 24 of 2017 to expedite and regulate the tax appeal process, was approved by the Cabinet.",
