  "decision_details": "- The  Kalyani  Samagri  maha  Sangha  Sabha  of  Shyamopali  Maha  Nikaya  of  Mahavihara  ancestry  is  performing  its  rites  of  higher  ordination  for  more  than  150  years  in  the  Udakukkepa  Seema  Malaka  which  has  been  temporarily  constructed  on  the  Kelani  River.  Considering  the  high  cost  and  also  the  labour  that  may  take  in  constructing  the  said  temporary  Seema  Malakaya  in  each  year,  the  Sangha  Sabha  has  decided  to  construct  a  permanent  Uposathagaraya  at  the  Kalyanawanshikaramaya  owned  by  the  said  Sanga  Sbha  located  adjacent  to  the  Kelani  River  in  Wennawatta.  Taking  into  account  the  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  Prime  Minister  on  this  matter,  Cabinet  decided  to  grant  its  approval  to  construct  the  historical  Kelani  River  Udakukkepa  Seema  Malaka  building,  based  on  the  recommendations  and  consultations  of  the  Department  of  Irrigation.",
