  "decision_details": "- Non\u2011availability of a permanent playground to the Isipathana College, Colombo where there are many talented players, has become a severe impediment to improve the skills of such players. Therefore, an Agreement was reached between the two parties in the year 2016 to use the Henry Pedris Ground owned by the Colombo Municipal Council to the sports activities of the Isipathana College, and the period of the said Agreement has ended in the year 2017. By handing over the Henry Pedris Ground to the Isipathana College, it can be properly improved and maintained and it will pave the way to productively utilize the said ground for the sports activities of the students of the College and also surrounding schools as well as the people of the area. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs to hand over the Henry Pedris Ground to the Isipathana College, keeping the name of the ground unchanged, was approved by the Cabinet.",
