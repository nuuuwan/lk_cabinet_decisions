  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted on 2016\u201107\u201126 to construct a building complex belonging to the National Social Development Institute under an initial cost estimate of Rs. 1000 million. Accordingly, the said construction contract had been awarded to the State Engineering Corporation  and the construction activities of the same had been scheduled to be completed and handed over in the year 2020. Nevertheless, the period of the relevant contract has been extended owing to the crisis situation which prevailed in the country during the period from 2019 to 2023. Due to the increase of prices of good during this period, the State Engineering Corporation has requested a price variation with regard to the construction cost. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment to pay Rs. 63.68 million, the value of the relevant price variation, to the State Engineering Corporation based on the recommendations of the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
