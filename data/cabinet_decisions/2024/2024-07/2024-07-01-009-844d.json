  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted on 2016\u201110\u201125 to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with the Government of India to construct 3,000 rainwater harvesting tanks in the District of Jaffna using the funds offered by the Government of India to supply clean potable water in the said District. Even though the project was scheduled to be completed within a period of 03 years, due to the financial and technical problems which have arisen, the Cabinet at its meeting held on 2022\u201110\u201110 has decided to extend the project period up to June 2024 and to install 1,831 PVC rainwater tanks instead of ferro-cement tanks. The proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to establish 934 water harvesting tanks using the remaining funds under the Project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
