  "decision_details": "- Approval  of  the  Cabinet  has  been  granted  on  2023\u201112\u201118  to  publish  the    Commission  for  Truth,  Unity  and  Reconciliation  in  Sri  Lanka  Bill  in  the  Government  Gazette.  Since  various  parties  have  proposed  further  amendments  to  the  said  Bill  thereafter,  action  has  not  been  taken  to  present  the  said  Bill  in  Parliament.  Having  conducted  several  rounds  of  consultations,  the  Interim  Secretariat  for  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Mechanism  has  identified  amendments  to  be  made  to  the  relevant  Bill.  Accordingly,  the  joint  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  President  in  his  capacity  as  the  Minister  of  Defence;  the  Minister  of  Justice  Prison  Affairs  and  Constitution  Reforms:  and  the  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  to  instruct  the  Legal  Draftsman  to  prepare  a  Bill  based  on  the  initial  draft  prepared  incorporating  the  said  amendments  as  well  and  to  revoke  the  Gazette  Notification  issued  publishing  the  relevant  Bill  earlier,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
