  "decision_details": "- The  Ayurveda  Act,  No.  31  of  1961  amended  by  the  Ayurveda  (Amendment)  Act,  No.  19  of  2023,  has  provided  the  legal  framework  for  the  implementation  of  Traditional  Medicine  System  in  the  country.  However,  no  single  National  policy  has  been  drafted  that  steers  the  direction  of  the  Government  Policy  for  the  Traditional  Medical  Service.  The  need  for  an  Traditional  National  Medical  Policy  has  arisen  in  the  National  Health  Policy  of  the  mainstream  in  order  to  solve  the  problems  that  have  arisen  in  the  current  service  delivery  and  to  present  a  quality  and  strong  medical  system  to  the  future  generation  by  preserving  the  Traditional  Medicine  System.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  President  in  his  capacity  as  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Economic  Stabilization  and  National  Policies  to  implement  the  National  Traditional  Medicine  Policy  of  Sri  Lanka  2024-2034  prepared  through  an  extensive  participatory  process  by  a  panel  of  experts,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
