A request has been made by the Chief Incumbent Thero of the Gangarama Temple to use the said plot of land which is currently underutilized to be developed as a Buddhist sacred site and as a place of tourist attraction where cultural heritage is displayed. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Urban Development and Housing to grant the said plot of land to the Sri Jinarathana Bhikku Abhyasa Vidyalaya Committee for development activities, on lease basis for a period of 50 years, based on the tax value determined by the Chief Government Valuer, was approved by the Cabinet.",
