  "decision_details": "- The  Bank  of  Ceylon  which  has  been  established  under  the  Bank  of  Ceylon  Ordinance,  No.  53  of  1938  is  a  leading  entity  operating  within  the  financial  market  in  Sri  Lanka  and  it  provides  an  outstanding  contribution  towards  the  growth  of  national  economy  as  a  state  owned  commercial  bank.  It  has  been  found  that  there  are  a  number  of  challenges  and  restrictions  in  the  said  Ordinance  which  is  currently  in  force  which  limits  the  achievement  of  optimum  return,  while  operating  in  the  competitive  and  dynamic  financial  market.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  President  in  his  capacity  as  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Economic  Stabilization  and  National  Policies  to  instruct  the  Legal  Draftsman  to  prepare  a  Bill  based  on    the  initial  draft  prepared  to  amend  the  Bank  of  Ceylon  Ordinance,  No.  53  of  1938  to  suit  the  present  day  needs,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
