  "decision_details": "- The  Green  Ammonia  which  is  a  value  added  product  of  Green  Hydrogen  has  been  identified  as  an  eco-friendly  alternative  to  conventional  fossil  fuels  for  the  transportation  of  energy  over  high  seas  for  long  distances.  The  demand  for  merchant  Green  Ammonia  which  can  be  used  to  carry  energy  is  being  significantly  increased  in  the  global  market.  It  has  also  predicted  that  the    demand  will  increase  to  billions  of  tons  by  2030.  Sri  Lanka  has  a  great  potential  to  be  established  as  a  green  energy  producer,  exporter  and  a  regional  energy  hub  due  to  its  unique  geographical  advantages  such  as  the  facts  that,  it  boasts  abundance  of  renewable  energy  resources  and  its  close  proximity  to  East-West  naval  route.  Therefore,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  President  in  his  capacity  as  the  Minister  of  Investment  Promotion  to  appoint  a  project  committee  comprising  of  the  representatives  of  relevant  institutions  to  evaluate  the  investment  proposals  of  the  private  sector  regarding  green  hydrogen/ammonia  production  and  submit  recommendations  to  the  Cabinet,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
