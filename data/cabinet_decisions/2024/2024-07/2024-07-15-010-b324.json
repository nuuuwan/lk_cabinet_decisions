  "decision_details": "- The  young  community  had  to  face  an  extremely  stressful  situation  due  to  the  restrictions  of  travel,  mutual  relationships,  personal  meetings  and  gatherings  in  groups  amidst  the  severe  impact  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  which  prevailed  globally  for  two  years  from  the  year  2019.  It  has  been  found  that  it  is  advisable  to  hold  recreational  programmes  islandwide  aimed  at  preventing  the  youth  from  being  subjected  to  such  pressures,  developing  their  entertainment,  enjoyment  and  mental  wellness,  providing  opportunities  for  the  young  community  to  maintain  social  relationships  physically,  and  giving  them  the  opportunity  to  work  together  as  well.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Minister  of  Sports  and  Youth  Affairs  to  implement  the  SMART  Youth  Exhibitions  &  Nights  -  2024  programme  covering  the  entire  island,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
