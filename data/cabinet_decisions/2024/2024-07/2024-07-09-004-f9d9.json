  "decision_details": "- The  Sri  Lanka  Land  Development  Corporation,  under  the  Greater  Colombo  Flood  Control  Project  to  minimize  flooding  in  the  area  around  Colombo  and  Sri  Jayewardenepura  Kotte,  has  acquired  marshy  land  plots  in  Colombo,  Sri  Jayewardenepura  Kotte,  Kolonnawa,  and  Kaduwela  divisional  secretariat  divisions,  to  the  Government  to  keep  them  as  water  retention  areas.  Certain  parties  are  attempting  to  utilize  the  water  retention  lands  located  adjacent  to  Buthgamuwa,  Rajagiriya  road  acquired  accordingly,  for  unauthorized  constructions  and  other  purposes,  and  it  seems  that,  it  is  suitable  to  utilize  such  lands  for  appropriate  development  purposes  under  the  guidance  of  the  Sri  Lanka  Land  Development  Corporation,  without  causing  a  harm  to  the  purposes  behind  taking  them  over  while  preserving  the  same.  Accordingly,  Cabinet  approved  the  proposal  made  by  the  Minister  of  Urban  Development  and  Housing  to  call  for  proposals  to  develop  a  plot  of  land  identified,  as  an  Urban  Park  with  income  generating  sources,  by  obtaining  the  contribution  of  the  private  sector  as  well.",
