  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that, in Sri Lanka, participation of women in economic activities is lower than other regional and Asian countries due to various reasons. According to the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey conducted in the year 2022, out of the economically active population, 35% is women and it shows a significant disparity in the gender contribution rates of economic participation. Limited financial literacy and the factors such as that women do not have property or other collateral required for obtaining loans and lack of opportunities to access financial resources have been identified as the main obstacles encountered by women entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the proposal made by the Hon. President to implement a special loan scheme in order to remove barriers preventing women from entering economic activities, utilizing Rs. 02 billion, out of Rs.20 billion which has been allocated to re-energize Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) Sector by the Cabinet decision dated 2024\u201102\u201126, was approved by the Cabinet.",
