  "decision_details": "- A Standardized Power Purchase Agreement should be entered into under a technology-based, Cost-reflective Feed in Tariff System pertaining to the Renewable Energy Projects with a capacity of 10MW or less as per the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No. 20 of 2009 and its subsequent amendments. Accordingly, although approval of the Cabinet has been granted on 2023\u201103\u201113 to implement a variable renewable energy purchasing tariff, only a few developers have signed the Agreement for that purpose. Therefore, a Committee comprising of representatives from the Ministry of Power and Energy, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Sri lanka and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been appointed in order to obtain recommendations on the renewable energy tariff calculation. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to accept the price calculation formula submitted by the said Committee and to implement the proposed tariff revisions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
