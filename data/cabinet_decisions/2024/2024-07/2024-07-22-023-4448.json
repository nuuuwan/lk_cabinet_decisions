  "decision_details": "- The severe economic crisis in the country during the past has directly and indirectly affected unfavourably to all sectors of the economy, and as a result, the pawning of jewellery has increased rapidly. The\toutstanding amount of pawning advances in year 2019, which was about Rs.210 billion, has shown a growth of 172% to around Rs.571 billion by March 2024. Taking this situation into consideration, the need to provide relief for low-income people who have obtained pawning advances from the licensed banks has been identified. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to implement a suitable programme to allocate an interest subsidy from the General Treasury, subject to maximum of 10% per annum for the pawning advances not exceeding Rs.100,000/- which have been obtained from the licensed banks by the customers on individual basis on 30th June, 2024 or before that, was approved by the Cabinet.",
