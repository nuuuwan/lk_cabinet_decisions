  "decision_details": "- Multi-Sectoral  National  Action  Plan  to  address  Sexual  and  Gender-based  Violence  in  Sri  Lanka  has  been  implemented  with  an  intergrated  approach  during  the  period  of  2012-2020  in  Sri  Lanka,  since  policy  interventions  are  needed  to  ensure  the  right  to  live  in  a  just  and  violence  free  society  for  women,  men,  children  and  all  gender  identities.  During  the  follow  up  and  evaluation  process  carried  out  regarding  the  impact  of  the  said  Action  Plan,  the  need  of  a  new  national  action  plan  has  been  identified.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  President  in  his  capacity  as  the  Minister  of  Women,  Child  Affairs  and  Social  Empowerment  to  implement  the  Multi-Sectoral  National  Action  Plan  to  address  Sexual  and  Gender-based  Violence  in  Sri  Lanka  -  II  (2024  -  2028)  which  has  been  prepared  seeking  the  views  of  all  relevant  stakeholder  institutions,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
