  "decision_details": "- Currently,  a  percentage  of  5%  is  allocated  annually  for  foreign  students  in  17  universities  under  the  University  Grants  Commission.  In  addition,  it  has  been  identified  that  the  aim  of  making  Sri  Lanka  the  Knowledge  Hub  in  Asia  can  be  achieved  by  expanding  the  opportunities  for  admission  of  foreign  students  to  the  26  Degree  Awarding  Institutions  recognized  by  section  25A  of  the  Universities  Act  as  well.  However,  it  is  observed  that  there  is  no  specific  methodology  to  determine  the  ability  to  comply  with  the  recognized  minimum  qualifications  considered  for  university  entrance  by  each  country,  as  a  requirement  for  admission  to  a  degree  in  a  Degree  Awarding  Institution  recognized  under  section  25A  of  the  Universities  Act  in  Sri  Lanka.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Minister  of  Education  to  consider  the  minimum  qualification  used  for  university  admission  in  193  member  countries  of  the  United  Nations  as  the  minimum  qualification  for  entering  into  Degree  courses  offered  by  the  recognized  Degree  Awarding  Institutions  under  section  25A  of  the  Universities  Act  in  Sri  Lanka  and  to  obtain  confirmation  from  the  UK  NARIC  Institution  for  exceptional  occassions  not  disclosed  by  the  said  qualifications,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
