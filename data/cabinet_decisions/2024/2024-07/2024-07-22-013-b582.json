  "decision_details": "- The Gadaladeniya Sadhdarmathilaka Rajamaha Viharaya was built during the Gampola Era according to the Pallawa architecture under the patronage of a thero known as Dharmakeerthi. It has been proposed to build a covering roof for the purpose of conserving the chamber of Gedige tradition of the said temple. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs to assign the above task to the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau which is an institution possessing the capacity and resources for that purpose, since the Department of Archaeology does not possess required human resources and technical equipment, was approved by the Cabinet.",
