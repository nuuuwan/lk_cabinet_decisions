  "decision_details": "- As stated in the Guidelines on Clinical Management of Covid-19, published by the Ministry of Health, cremation has been recommended as the method of disposing of those who have died of the virus. Accordingly, 276 individuals who succumbed to Covid-19 from the Muslim population were cremated and subsequently in February 2021 such individuals were permitted to bury with strict restrictions. In July 2021, the then Ministry of Water Supply with the assistance of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura initiated a study to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aquatic environments of Colombo and Kandy, including river water, waste water discharged from hospitals, quarantine centres and other potential sites. The study revealed that there is no virus in the surface water. A second study was also completed in March 2024 by the China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology under the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, which confirmed that primary source of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to water sources including groundwater was through faeces and urine and not safe burials. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Justice, prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development to tender an apology by the Sri Lankan Government from the social groups affected due to the mandatory cremation policy enforced in Sri Lanka amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, was approved by the Cabinet.",
