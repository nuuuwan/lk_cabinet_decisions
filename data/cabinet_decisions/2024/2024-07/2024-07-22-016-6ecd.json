  "decision_details": "- Subsequent to the passage of the Online Safety Act in Parliament adhering to the decision given by the Supreme Court pertaining to the said Bill, the Online Safety Act No.9 of 2024 is in force at present. Even though, experts in the field had proposed amendments with regard to certain clauses in the said Bill prior to the passage of the said Bill in Parliament, it was not possible to incorporate such amendments to the Bill at the Committee Stage. Accordingly, approval has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2024\u201102\u201112 to prepare a Bill to amend the Online Safety Act No.9 of 2024 by incorporating the said amendments. As such, the clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman. The Proposal made by the Minister of Public Security to publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and to submit the same thereafter to Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
