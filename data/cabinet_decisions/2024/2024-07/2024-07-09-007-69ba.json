  "decision_details": "- The  National  Transport  Commission  has  started  the  Sisu  Seria  Project  since  2005,  with  the  aim  of  providing  a  more  reliable  bus  service  under  a  concessionary  fare  system  so  that  school  children  can  come  to  school  punctually  without  mental  or  physical  discomfort  and  go  home  safely  after  completing  their  educational  activities.  Under  that  project,  students  are  transported  by  the  the  Sri  Lanka  Transport  Board  and  private  buses.  1,537  Sisu  Seriya  bus  services  are  currently  operating  covering  all  the  district  in  Sri  Lanka,  providing  transportation  facilities  to  about  one  lakhs  of  school  children  per  day.  As  students  are  charged  only  half  of  the  bus  fare  under  the  project,  subsidy  payments  will  be  made  at  the  rate  of  Rs.105/-  per  kilometer  for  a  maximum  of  110  kilometers  per  day  to  compensate  for  the  loss  incurred  to  the  bus  operator.  The  requests  made  by  the  parents  and  schools  who  have  not  been  able  to  secure  private  transport  facilities  and  are  economically  distressed  owing  to  the  increase  of  fuel  prices,  have  been  increased.  Accordingly,  the  proposal  made  by  the  Minister  of  Transport  and  Highways  to  allocate  provisions  amounting  to  Rs.202  million  required  to  start  500  new  Sisu  Seriya  bus  services  in  the  year  2024  from  the  revenue  earned  by  the  National  Transport  Commission,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
