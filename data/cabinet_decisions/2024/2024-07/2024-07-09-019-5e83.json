  "decision_details": "- Since  the  communities  living  in  the  existing  housing  settlements  in  the  plantation  areas  are  not  systematically  receiving  the  services  provided  by  the  Government  institutions  at  village  level,  the  necessity  of  converting  the  plantation  housing  settlements  into  settlement  villages  has  been  identified  in  order  to  treat  them  with  respect  and  dignity.  Accordingly,  it  is  expected  to  introduce  a  new  legislation  to  amalgamate  the  plantation  housing  settlements  and  line  rooms  currently  found  in  the  plantation  areas  and  convert  them  into  villages.  The  proposal  made  by  the  Hon.  President  to  instruct  the  Legal  Draftsman  to  prepare  a  Bill  for  the  same,  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet.",
