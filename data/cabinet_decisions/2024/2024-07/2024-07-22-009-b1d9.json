  "decision_details": "- As referred to at the Guidelines published by the Ministry of Health on Clinical Management of COVID-19, the cremation of dead bodies of persons succumbed to the COVID virus was made mandatory. This decision caused concern among various religious groups, human rights activists and particularly those who are professing the Islam. Pursuant to the later studies made thereon, it has been confirmed the fact that the primary source of transmission of the COVID virus to the water sources including groundwater is merely through faeces and urine and not through the safe burials. Therefore, attention has been focused on introducing a law that allows a person or a relative to choose the burial or cremation of the deceased as per their wish in order to avoid such situations in future. Further, it has appeared that it would also be appropriate to introduce relevant laws for donation of bodies to Faculties of Medicine, if found necessary. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to introduce a new law, was approved by the Cabinet.",
