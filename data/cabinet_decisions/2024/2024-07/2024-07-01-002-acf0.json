  "decision_details": "- The Mahabage Police Station which serves nearly 50,000 people living in 08 Grama Niladhari Divisions, is currently maintained in a small plot of land in extent of 21.5 perches bordering the Colombo - Negombo main road. Under this backdrop, due to the facts that there is no suitable place for vehicle parking and to keep court productions in safe custody, inadequate barracks and non availability of quarters for the officers, both the general public and the serving police officers encounter severe difficulties. Therefore, the proposal made by the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government to allocate a plot of land in extent of 40 perches from the land where the Wattala divisional Secretariat Division has been previously established for the development of required facilities for the said police station, was approved by the Cabinet.",
