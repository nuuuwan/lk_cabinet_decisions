  "decision_details": "- Kalmunai town is one of the main service centres in the Ampara district and it is considered as an administrative, trade and commercial centre of the province. According to the Development Plan for the Kalmunai Municipal Council area, the coastal area of Kalmunai has been designated as a suitable area for tourism and recreational activities, but it has been recognized that the facilities available in the town are not adequate for tourism and recreational activities. Accordingly, in order to meet such requirements, the proposal made by the Minister of Urban Development and Housing to take over a plot of land in extent of 01 rood 29.44 perches located in Rest House road in the coastal area of Kalmunai to the Urban Development Authority for a project to construct a Tourism Facility Centre, was approved by the Cabinet.",
