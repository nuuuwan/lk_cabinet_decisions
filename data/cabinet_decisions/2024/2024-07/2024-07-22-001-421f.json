  "decision_details": "- Disjointed programmes, schemes, institutions and products which are integral in the current Social Protection System are proven to have limited effectiveness in the said Social Protection System and less contribution to the National development. Accordingly, the Ministry of Finance,Economic Stabilization and National Policies has identified the necessity of having a Social Protection System for Sri Lanka. The National Social Protection Policy has been formulated to provide a strategic guidance for the development of a well-coordinated and harmonized Social Protection System with the contribution of all relevant parties. The proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, to implement the said Policy was approved by the Cabinet.",
