  "decision_details": "- An  Agreement  has  been  entered  into  between  Electra  Ltd  UK  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  in  the  year  2013  for  the  supply  of  14  Linear  Accelerators  (LINAC)  machines  under  two  phases,  utilized  for  cancer  treatments.  Accordingly,  the  first  phase  of  the  said  project  has  already  been  implemented  whereas  the  second  phase  of  the  same  has  not  yet  been  implemented.  Since  many  important  features  which  are  standards  of  modern  cancer  treatments  utilized  at  present  are  not  available  in  the  specifications  of  the  Initial  Agreement  signed  in  2013,  a  proposal  has  been  submitted  by  Oncologists  in  Sri  Lanka  to  secure  upgraded  machines.  Accordingly,      the  Cabinet  granted  its  approval  to  upgrade  the  LINAC  machines  provided  to  the  National  Hospital  of  Kandy,  National  Hospital  of  Karapitiya,  Teaching  Hospital  of  Jaffna  and  the  Teaching  Hospital  of  Batticaloa  under  the  first  phase  and  to  secure  the  modern  Radiotherapy  equipment  for  05  Hospitals  of  Rathnapura,  Badulla,  Hambanthota,  Anuradhapura  and  Kurunegala  under  the  second  phase  within  the  Medium  Term  Budgetary  Framework  2024\u20112026  on  priority  basis,  taking  into  consideration  the  proposals  submitted  by  the  Minister  of  Health  and  based  on  the  recommendations  submitted  by  the  Oncologists  and  those  of  the  Technical  Evaluation  Committee.",
