  "decision_details": "- The  Secretary  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Economic  Stabilization  and  National  Policies  was  instructed  at  the  Cabinet  meeting  held  on  2024-05-22  to  estimate  the  salary  to  be  paid  for  a  plantation  worker  per  day,  giving  due  consideration  to  the  cost  of  living  and  the  impact  caused  by  the  economic  crisis  which  has  arisen  in  the  country  recently.  And,  it  was  also  decided  at  the  Cabinet  meeting  to  appoint  a  committee  to  determine  the  capacity  of  each  Regional  Plantation  Company  to  pay  the  said  remuneration.  The  Cabinet  decided  to  expedite  the  process  of  enacting  necessary  legislation  to  cancel  the  Land  Lease  Agreements  entered  into  by  the  Government  with  the  Regional  Plantation  Companies  which  do  not  pay  the  due  remuneration  to  their  plantation  workers,  inspite  of  having  the  capacity  to  do  so  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  said  committee.",
