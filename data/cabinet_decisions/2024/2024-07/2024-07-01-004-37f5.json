  "decision_details": "- The United Nations Environment Programme, an organization accredited by the Green Environment Fund, has granted US$ 1.09 million for the implementation of the project on Sustainable and Efficient Electric Mobility System in Sri Lanka. According to the project implementation plan, the Ministry of Environment has been identified as the National Designated Entity. However, since the scope of the project falls under the Ministry of Transport and Highways, the Ministry of Transport and Highways has the ability to take necessary measures to implement the project more efficiently together with all the relevant parties. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport and Highways, for the Ministry of Transport and Highways to become the executing agency of the said project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
