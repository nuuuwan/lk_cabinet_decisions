  "decision_details": "- The Covid\u201119 pandemic followed by the economic crisis and the high fuel prices had an extremely negative impact on the Fisheries Industry in Sri Lanka. The owners of the fishing vessels have to bear a huge working capital for fuel on launching the vessels and as a result engaging the vessels in fishing operations has been limited. Therefore, it has been identified the need to provide relief for the fuel used in the fishing industry and thereby, quickly restoring the said industry. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies and the Minister of Fisheries to grant an allowance of the revival of fisheries industry to the vessel owners who use diesel as fuel to receive a sum of Rs.25/- per litre and to the vessel owners using kerosene as fuel to receive a sum of Rs.25/- per litre, subject to 15 litres per day for a maximum of 25 days per month, for a period of 06 months, was approved by the Cabinet.",
