  "decision_details": "- It has been found that the facts such as increase of the prices of fertilizer and ban on the chemical fertilizer during the past period have caused to the decrease of use of fertilizer thereby declining the tea production. Therefore, it has been a timely requirement to provide a relief to the tea growers in view of promoting the use of fertilizer to increase the tea production. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries to provide a 50kg bag of chemical fertilizer with a concession of Rs.4,000/- through State Fertilizer Company Limited, the state-owned fertilizer company, to the tea growers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
