  "decision_details": "- The Welfare Benefits Board currently implements the 'Aswesuma' Benefits Scheme and the selection of the relevant beneficiaries is carried out as per the Welfare Benefit Payment (Selection of Persons Eligible to Receive Payments) Regulations No.1 of 2022 made under the Welfare Benefits Act, No. 24 of 2002. Individuals or families who fulfill the eligible criteria prescribed under the said Regulations are entitled to receive 'Aswesuma' benefits. In the plantation sector, the extended families of plantation workers often reside in shared line rooms due to the unavailability of individual housing within the estates. According to the current practice, all individuals living in the line rooms are treated as one family unit, irrespective of the number of separate families cohabiting in these spaces and this situation seems disadvantageous for the said families. Therefore, the proposal made by the Hon. President to direct the Welfare Benefits Board to pursue action taking into account the actual plantation worker families living in line rooms in determining the eligible criteria for the 'Aswesuma' Scheme under the Welfare Benefit Payment (Selection of Persons Eligible to Receive Payments) Regulations No.1 of 2022, was approved by the Cabinet.",
