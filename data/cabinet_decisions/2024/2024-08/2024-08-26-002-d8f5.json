  "decision_details": "- Eventhough Sri Lanka has already achieved a significant progress on its digital transformation journey, has yet to make a substantial impact on the global Artificial Intelligence platform. The use of artificial intelligence in key sectors such as agriculture, health services and education has the potential to increase the productivity and enhance the Government services. Thus, it makes a powerful contribution to achieve a sustainable economic growth and eradicate poverty, and also paves the way to equally distribute the benefits of Artificial Intelligence throughout the society. Sri Lanka's National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence has been prepared with the aim of fostering a digitally empowered Sri Lanka through the development and use of Artificial Intelligence. Accordingly, by the year 2030, Sri Lanka is expected to be positioned as a regional hub for artificial intelligence thereby increasing its global competitiveness and economic resilience. The proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Technology to implement Sri Lanka's National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence, which has been prepared to achieve these objectives, was approved by the Cabinet.",
