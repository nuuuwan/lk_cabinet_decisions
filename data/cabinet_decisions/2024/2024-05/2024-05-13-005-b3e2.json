  "decision_details": "- The approach to collectively utilize the electricity network of electricity transmission and distribution to provide electricity to a place which require electricity is known as Power Wheeling Facility. Under the Power Wheeling Facility, it enables the electricity consumers to utilize their own energy plants situated elsewhere using the existing electricity network by minimizing the electricity cost effectively, subject to payment of a charge. Since there are no legal provisions to implement said system in Sri Lanka, a Committee has been appointed to conduct a detailed study pertaining to the provision of that facility. The proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to implement the Power Wheeling Facility only for new renewable energy projects, based on the recommendations of the said Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
