  "decision_details": "- Provision of Rs. 212.59 billion has been allocated through the Budget 2024 to several ministries under 50 proposals for the sectors identified as in need of expeditious development. Projects related to 13 of those proposals are being implemented under the Presidential Secretariat. Due to the economic crisis prevailed in the last few years and having to halt certain development programmes initiated with foreign aids until the completion of debt restructuring process, the rural communities have been deprived of the benefits of the development programmes that had been planned to be implemented at the rural level. In particular, requests have been received from the various parties for the speedy completion of development projects such as rural roads, bridges, small tanks, canals development, rural enterprise development programmes as well as rural schools, hospitals, low-income housing and rural water supply. As a remedy to the above, the proposal made by the Hon. President to submit a proposal to Parliament to use the anticipated funds saved from the programmes that have been allocated under the Presidential Secretariat, to complete the essential development work that are implemented at the rural level and the rural development tasks which have been halted halfway, was approved by the Cabinet.",
