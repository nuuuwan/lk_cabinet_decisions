Accordingly, the absorption process of the employees is currently underway and it has been decided to introduce a Voluntary Retirement Scheme as an alternative and to make a payment for the employees who retire voluntarily, taking into account the market factors. The proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to implement the said Voluntary Retirement Scheme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
