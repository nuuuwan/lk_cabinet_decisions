  "decision_details": "- In order to achieve the target of meeting 70% of the country's electricity demand from renewable energy resources by 2030, it is imperative to absorb the targeted renewable energy capacities which will be generated through the projects expected to be implemented during the period of 2024-2030 to the National electricity Grid. The Government has focused special attention to develop the wind and solar potentials in the country and with the gradual increase of variable Renewable Energy integration to the power system, a more flexible power system is required to ensure the reliability of the system. As an appropriate method for the purpose, Battery Energy Storage Systems has been identified under the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan. Based on the recommendations of the Committee appointed to examine and submit recommendations regarding the application of that system during the period of 2024-2023, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to develop identified battery capacities to connect to the national electricity grid through private investments or public-private partnership methods, was approved by the Cabinet.",
