The Blue Flag Beach Certification Programme is one of the prominent programmes out of those programmes and is also a popular eco-friendly brand among the tourists. The Blue Flag Certification is issued under this programme for the beach in concern on meeting 32 criteria under four (04) main elements of water quality, environmental management, environmental education information and the people's safety. The Blue Flag Certification is issued by the Foundation of Environmental Education in Denmark and in order to issue the Blue Flag Certificates in Sri Lanka, it is necessary to have an organization in this country that has obtained the affiliated membership of the said institution.
