  "decision_details": "- Following the conclusion of the G.C.E (Ordinary Level) Examination, the Department of Examinations takes at least 03 months to release the results of the said exam. Dropping out of students from school education during this period has resulted a decline in student enrollment to pursue G.C.E (Advanced Level) thereby creating various social problems as well. Taking into account the said matters, it has been identified that it would be appropriate to commence academic activities of Advanced Level in schools just after the completion of the G.C.E (Ordinary Level) Examination in the year 2024, enabling the students to manage their time efficiently and to provide teachers with adequate time period to cover the G.C.E (Advanced Level) syllabus. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to commence G.C.E (Advanced Level) classes for students who sat for the G.C.E (Ordinary Level) Examination for the year 2023 in May 2024 immediately after the said examination, was approved by the Cabinet.",
