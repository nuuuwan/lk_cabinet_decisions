  "decision_details": "- Although the Sri Lanka Excise Department is a revenue-generating Department, inefficiency of the old systems available with the Department to assist for its revenue administration functions has resulted in deficiencies such as the related loss of revenue and irregularities as well as it has led to the difficulty in accessing the information required by public and other relevant parties. Similarly, problematic situations have emerged in working together with information systems of other Institutions. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to introduce a Revenue Administration System for Sri Lanka Excise Department with a view to installing more efficient and productive Information Communication Technology System in order to carry out the basic functions such as exchange of all data, risk management and revenue reconciliation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
