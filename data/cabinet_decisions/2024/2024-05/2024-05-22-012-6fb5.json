  "decision_details": "- In terms of the provisions of the Firearms Ordinance No. 33 of 1916 and the Firearms (Amendment) Act No.22 of 1996, the Ministry of Defence issues firearms on licenses for agricultural and non-agricultural purposes and an annual tax is levied in respect of the same. The number of firearms issued so far by the Ministry of Defence is 34,318 and approximately Rs 45 million is credited to the General Treasury annually as license fees. Although the Ministry of Defence has taken necessary action to fully amend the Firearms Ordinance No. 33 of 1916 and the Firearms (Amendment) Act No.22 of 1996 to suit with timely requirements, it has been found necessary to amend the relevant license fee to suit with the present day needs until the aforesaid amendments are made. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence to expeditiously amend subsection (1) of section 24 and section 34 of the Firearms Ordinance so as to pursue action accordingly, was approved by the Cabinet.",
