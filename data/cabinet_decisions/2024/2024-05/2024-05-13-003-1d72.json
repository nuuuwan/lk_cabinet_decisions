  "decision_details": "- Students are given the opportunity to study Advanced Level Vocational Stream irrespective of their passing/failing at the G.C.E (Ordinary Level) Examination and at present, the said stream is in operation in 604 schools covering almost all Educational Divisions. Under the said stream, general subjects which develop soft skills should be followed in Grade 12, whereas, in Grade 13, students are provided with the opportunity to follow a NVQ Level 4 course for 06 months and obtain an on-the-job training of 06 months. 17 Vocational Training Institutions operating under 07 ministries have entered into Memoranda of Understanding with the Ministry of Education to continue NVQ level 4 courses for those students. As there are currently about 50,000 students registered to study under the Vocational Stream, it has been found the necessity to give priority to those students by all the Vocational Training Institutions operating under the the Government to provide relevant vocational training. Accordingly, Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Minister of Education, to make it a mandatory task of the Vocational Training Institutions operating under all ministries to provide vocational training to the students who study Advanced level Vocational Stream and give priority to Vocational Stream students when enrolling students in the NVQ 4 courses of those Institutions annually and provide facilities required for training.",
