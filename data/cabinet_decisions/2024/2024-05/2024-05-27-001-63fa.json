  "decision_details": "- There are 52 Circuit Bungalows managed by the Department of Wildlife Conversations at present and it has been found necessary to develop the physical facilities in those Bungalows in order to provide more qualitative services through the said Bungalows. It has been identified that it would be appropriate to physically develop the said Circuit Bungalows so as to provide a high quality service, with the participation of private sector institutions and parties who are interested in voluntarily contributing to those activities, in a manner that does not contravene the provisions of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation to call for Expressions of Interest from the said parties and enter into Memoranda of Understanding with the parties selected accordingly and the Department of Wildlife Conservation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
