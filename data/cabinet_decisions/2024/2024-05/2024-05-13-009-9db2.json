  "decision_details": "- Circular instructions have been issued from time to time by the Commissioner General of Lands on approval of the Cabinet on the procedure to be followed in allotting State lands for residential purposes to the war heroes of the Tri-Forces, Sri Lanka Police and Department of Civil Security who have sacrificed their lives, gone missing, disabled while serving in the war front, retired and those who are still engaged in active service. It has been observed that the concessions offered to the war heroes with the approved procedures at present are not adequate and the real economic value of the said lands is not depicted due to the restrictive factors prevailing in the legal instruments with conditions for the lands in possession. Therefore, the proposal made by the Hon. President to take necessary action to revise the existing system by incorporating solutions to the problems that have arisen due to the current system when granting lands to the war heroes, was approved by the Cabinet.",
