  "decision_details": "- More than 2,000 cases are pending in the courts of various provinces due to the non-payment of outstanding statutory dues by Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation, Janatha Estates Development Board and Elkaduwa Plantation Company Limited. Since the earnings of these institutions are not sufficient to pay the said outstanding statutory dues, it has been identified that it is appropriate to provide the required cash amount for that purpose as a loan by the General Treasury and recover the relevant loan in installsments from the earnings of these institutions. After fully settling the total contribution of the Employees' Provident Fund by these institutions, the Commissioner General of Labour has the ability to reduce the surcharge payable with regard to that amount, in accordance with the provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to provide necessary funds from the General Treasury for the payment of outstanding statutory dues of the institutions, Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation, Janatha Estates Development Board and Elkaduwa Plantation Company Limited and to instruct the Commissioner General of Labour to reduce the maximum amount that can be deducted from the surcharges to be paid by the said institutions as per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund Act, No. 15 of 1958 after settlement of the outstanding statutory dues, was approved by the Cabinet.",
