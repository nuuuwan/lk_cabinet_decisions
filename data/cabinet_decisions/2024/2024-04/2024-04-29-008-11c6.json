  "decision_details": "- It has been recognized that, in addition to the regular in-service training courses conducted for officers of the Department of Forest Conservation, conducting training programmes for officers in Government and Non-government institutions as well using the facilities available in the Sri lanka Forestry Institute could develop positive attitudes towards forests among them and their knowledge and skills. Further, providing the facilities of the Sri Lanka Forestry Institute to other Institutions and the public also enables the Government to earn an additional income. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation to provide the Sri Lanka Forestry Institute, Nuwara Eliya and its Inamaluwa Field Training Centre to external parties for conducting short term training programmes, was approved by the Cabinet.",
