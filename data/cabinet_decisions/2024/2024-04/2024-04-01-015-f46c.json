  "decision_details": "- Although it is generally considered as an accepted practice in the tourism industry the fact that the age of vehicles used for the transportation of tourists does not exceed 06 years, it has been found that the condition of vehicles used for the transportation of tourists is unsatisfactory and inadequate due to restriction on importation of vehicles and essential spare parts and the reputation gained by Sri Lanka as a leading tourist destination is somewhat damaged owing to the use of outdated vehicles. Therefore, it has been identified the necessity of importing essential vehicles for the growth of the tourism sector, taking into account the contribution of the tourism sector within the economic revitalization process of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to import 750 vans with 6 -15 seats (including electric and hybrid vehicles) and 250 vehicles including mini coaches with 16-30 seats and coaches with 30-45 seats to be utilized for the transportation of tourists in particular, without granting special duty concessions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
