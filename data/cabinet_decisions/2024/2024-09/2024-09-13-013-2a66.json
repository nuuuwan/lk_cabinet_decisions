  "decision_details": "- Mr. Diyunuge Edward Henry Pedris who was then 27 years old, had been sentenced to death on 1915\u201107\u201107 without considering any appeal by the Colonial Administration of Sri Lanka, being convicted for the offence of treason, having court\u2011martialed him, allegedly accusing him of inciting riots and treason against the Government. The remains of Mr. Diyunuge Edward Henry Pedris had been cremated in an undisclosed location by adopting the procedure prescribed for cremating a criminal convicted under the martial law. It had been revealed later that his assassination had been executed as a plan of the senior officials who ruled the country then. Accordingly, upon the submission of the Gazette Extraordinary Notification No.2401/23 dated 2024\u201109\u201112 issued by the Hon. President, on the posthumous Presidential Pardon granted to the Late Mr. Diyunuge Edward Henry Pedris who had been unlawfully executed on 1915\u201107\u201107 after an unjust trial, it was decided to grant the concurrence of the Cabinet for the action taken by the Hon. President.",
