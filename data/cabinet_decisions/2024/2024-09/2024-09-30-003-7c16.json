  "decision_details": "- It has been decided at the Cabinet meeting held on 2023-02-13 that the approval of the Minister in-charge of Finance should be obtained when releasing imprest to the relevant ministries by the General Treasury for certain expenses, based on the priority of such expenses. However, since it has been observed that it is not necessary to use a priority basis in the release of imprest further, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Development, Policy Formulation, Planning and Tourism to authorize the Secretary to the Ministry in-charge of Finance for the release of imprest for incurring essential expenses without obtaining the special approval of the Minister in-charge of Finance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
