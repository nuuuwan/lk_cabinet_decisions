  "decision_details": "- Since the Mahapola and Bursary installments granted for university students have not been increased from 2015 to date, the necessity of revising the said installment amount had been brought to the notice of the Cabinet through a joint Memorandum submitted by the Minister of Education and the Minister Trade, Commerce and Food Security. Taking into consideration the said proposal, the Cabinet granted approval to increase the Mahapola installment up to Rs.7,500/- and the Bursary installment up to Rs.6,500/- with effect from April 2025.",
