  "decision_details": "- Approval of the cabinet has been granted in 2016 to establish a National Trade Facilitation Committee to enforce the Trade Facilitation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and coordinate the inter agency activities associated with the implementation of 36 commitments in the said Agreement. Under that, Sri Lanka is committed to implement the plan for the implementation of trade facilities within the period of 2017 - 2030. Countries in the Region have met a high percentage of the overall commitments of the said plan, but Sri Lanka has fulfilled only 37.4% of the total commitments. Considering the said situation, technical assistance has been requested from the Japan International Cooperation Agency with the technical expertise of the International Trade Center to conduct a complete assessment of the trade facilitation measures and to make independent recommendations so that the priority measures could be implemented on a fast-track basis. Accordingly, the \"Trade Facilitation Roadmap for Sri Lanka\" and the \"Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2025\u2011 2028\" have been prepared with the participation of about 200 public and private stakeholders. The proposal made by the Hon. President to adopt the said Road Map and implement the action plan, was approved by the Cabinet.",
