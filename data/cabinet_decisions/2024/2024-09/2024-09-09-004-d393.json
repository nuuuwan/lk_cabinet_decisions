  "decision_details": "- Approximately 20% of the wheat seeds imported into Sri Lanka are removed as bran pellets during the processing of wheat flour. There is a possibility of earning a large amount of foreign exchange by exporting the bran so removed as wheat bran pellets, to China. For that purpose, the necessity to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between the two parties to follow a specific procedure has been identified. The concurrence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been received for the drafted Memorandum of Understanding. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries to sign the said Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries and the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China, was approved by the Cabinet.",
