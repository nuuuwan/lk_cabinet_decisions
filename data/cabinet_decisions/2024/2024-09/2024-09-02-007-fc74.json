  "decision_details": "- SriLankan Airlines currently operates a fleet of 13 aircrafts with internet facilities, enabling the passengers to use Wi-Fi facilities and GSM services on mobile phones. Since the air passengers have to experience low internet speed with the existing outdated internet facility, the need of providing a fast internet application facility has been identified. Ka and Ku bands are used for high-end connections and due to the high frequency range available, through Ka-band provides high data transfer at a speed. It has been recognized that the Ka-band connection is more suitable for high-speed Internet access, streaming services and other data-intensive operations. Accordingly, the proposal submitted by Viasat Company, the sole provider of Ka-band connectivity offering hardware, software and internet facilities with global coverage for commercial aircrafts, have been evaluated and recommendations submitted by the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee. The proposal made by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation to award the Contract for the provision of Ka-band high-speed satellite technology Internet connection facilities for seven (07) A330-300 model aircraft of SriLankan Airlines Limited to Viasat Inc. for a period of 07 years, based on the said recommendations, was approved by the Cabinet.",
