  "decision_details": "- Existence of a clear, simple, coherent and predictable tariff regime is a critical factor in maintaining a competitive environment for trade and investment within a country. The competitive environment for investments in Sri Lanka has been adversely affected due to the revision of the Tariff Policy according to the various policies introduced by the previous governments from time to time. Taking this situation into consideration, a Technical Committee has been appointed under the Chairmanship of the Director General of the Trade and Investment Policy Department of the General Treasury with the composition of members from the relevant agencies to prepare a National Tariff Policy as per the instructions of the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies. The Committee has prepared a National Tariff Policy under the guidance of trade experts and the Secretaries of the subject related Ministries in consultation with the Business and Industry Community. The proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to implement the above National Tariff Policy under three (03) phases from January 2025 and publish the same through a Gazette Notification under section 101 of the Customs Ordinance with a view to ensure the stakeholders' awareness and compliance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
