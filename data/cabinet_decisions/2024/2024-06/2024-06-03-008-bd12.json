  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet at its meeting held on 2023\u201103\u201107 has granted approval to amend the Criminal Procedure Code enabling to introduce the plea agreements to the legal framework in Sri Lanka with a view to resolving criminal cases expeditiously, minimizing the backlogs of cases by reducing delays in court proceedings and reducing prison overcrowding. According to the proposed amendment, the accused person and prosecution enter into an agreement where the accused will plead guilty instead of going to trial, in consequence of which, recommendation could be obtained to minimize sentence and reduce fine or restitution amount. Accordingly, the clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman to amend the Criminal Procedure Code. The proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to publish the relevant Bill in the Government Gazette and submit the same thereafter, to Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
