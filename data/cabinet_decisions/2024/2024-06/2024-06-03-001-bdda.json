  "decision_details": "- As of 2024\u201105\u201101, selected edible grains and commodities which have been classified under 126 HS Codes, have been subjected to the Import Control License whereas issuance of import control license relating to 53 HS Codes has been suspended as of now. In this backdrop, it has been found appropriate to remove the requirement of Import Control License for importation of grains in order to achieve the multiple objectives of eliminating black-market operation, illicit importation of grains, preventing the inflated retail price in an unfair and unjust manner and ensuring affordable price to the consumer and protection of domestic production by imposition of appropriate rate of duties and quarantine procedures. Accordingly, taking into account the recommendations made by a Committee chaired by the Secretary to the President and comprising of the Members of the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Secretary to the General Treasury and the Senior Economic Advisor to the President, the proposal made by the Hon. President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to remove the requirement of Import Control License for importation of green gram, black gram, cow peas, kurakkan, flour of soya beans and ground nuts while taking necessary measures so as to protect the local manufacturers, subject to  submission of the National Plant Quarantine Permit of the National Plant Quarantine Service and based on the recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
