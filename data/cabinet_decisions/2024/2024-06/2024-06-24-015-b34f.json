  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2023\u201109\u201125 to amend the section 7 of the Mediation Boards Act, No.72 of 1988, in order to overcome administrative issues such as unavailability of constituted or functioning mediation boards or delay in issuing the Certificate of Non\u2011settlement by the Mediation Board and to fulfill the requirement of not preventing the parties from resorting to the Court of Law, in the event both parties accept that there is no settlement. Accordingly, the Legal Draftsman has prepared the amending Bill and the clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the same. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, to publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter present the same for approval in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
