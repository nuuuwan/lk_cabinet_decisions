  "decision_details": "- Approval of the cabinet has been granted at the meeting held on 2019\u201107\u201107 for the construction of a Fishery Harbour at the existing Gandara landing site. Although the project was supposed to be completed by December 2023, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic crisis, constructions of the project could not be completed as expected. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Fisheries to extend the period of the project from December 2023 to December 2026, enabling to complete all construction works including the shore facilities of the project as well; and to revise the total cost estimate based on price variations, was approved by the cabinet.",
