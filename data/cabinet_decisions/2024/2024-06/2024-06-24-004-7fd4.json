  "decision_details": "- A plot of land with an extent of 30 perches at Welikada, Rajagiriya owned by\t the Urban Development Authority, has been provided to the Ceylon College of Physicians for a period of 30 years with effect from 1999\u201105\u201113 on a concessionary lease basis for the construction of a building for research purposes. In view of the fact that the Head Office building of the Ceylon College of Physicians, which has been built in the above land, needs to be repaired and a considerable financial investment has to be made for it, the institution has submitted a request to provide the land in concern, back on lease basis for a longer period of time. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Acting Minister of Urban Development and Housing to provide the relevant portion of land to the Ceylon College of Physicians for a period\tof 50 years on long-term lease basis, based on charging an annual rent determined by the Chief  Government Valuer, was approved by the Cabinet.",
