  "decision_details": "- The significance of attracting export-oriented Foreign Direct Investment, diversifying exports and expanding market access for goods and services, has been identified in order to regain the economic stability in Sri Lanka. For that purpose, it is essential for Sri Lanka to further economic integration with countries having strong and strategic economies. Malaysia, a key member of the ASEAN and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, stands as the 34th export destination for Sri Lanka and value of the total exports to Malaysia in 2023 is USD 58.3 million. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to take into consideration the importance of entering into a Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and Malaysia and initiate the negotiations for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
