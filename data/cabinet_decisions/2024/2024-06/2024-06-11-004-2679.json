  "decision_details": "- Regionally established micro, small and medium scale industries have to encounter many conflicts at present and the need for a more suitable, easily accessible and inclusive approach has been identified in order to create an enabling environment to face these challenges. Therefore, it has become essential to establish, network and promote strong linkages among all the relevant institutions enabling to provide quality and efficient institutional assistance and service delivery at the regional level for micro, small and medium scale industries through a multi-sectoral and integrated approach. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Industries to establish 25 \"District Industry Promotion Councils\" covering the entire island and appoint a Steering Committee consisting of the representatives from the public sector, private sector and other relevant institutions to determine the structure, functions and responsibilities and to oversee the whole process of the above councils, was approved by the Cabinet.",
