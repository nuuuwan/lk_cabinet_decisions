  "decision_details": "- Although the annual Cashew Nuts in Shell of the country is about 25,000 metric tons, currently only 12,500 metric tons can be procured locally. Due to the failure to yield the expected harvest in the last season, there has been a very unfavorable situation for the existence of the cashew industry in the country. Taking into account this situation, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries to import  a maximum of 15,000 metric tons of  Cashew Nuts in Shell for this year; and thereafter to import a stock of  Cashew Nuts in Shell which is determined by a Committee comprised of the senior officers of relevant Ministries, for next 04 years, during the period from December to April, when the local cashews are not harvested, was approved by the Cabinet.",
