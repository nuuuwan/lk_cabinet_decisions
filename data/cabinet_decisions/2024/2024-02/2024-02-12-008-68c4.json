  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, in collaboration with the National Housing Development Authority and licensed banks, has planned to implement a housing programme for migrant workers. Under the said programme, it is expected to provide a loan facility of a maximum of Rs. 10 million and to bear a part of interest cost for that by the  Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment. The loan obtained under the proposed loan facility should be settled by the borrower in foreign currency remitted through legal channels during the period in which the borrower is engaged in a foreign employment and he/she would be able to pay it in Sri lankan Rupees after returning to the country having completed the foreign employment. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment to implement the proposed Housing Programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
