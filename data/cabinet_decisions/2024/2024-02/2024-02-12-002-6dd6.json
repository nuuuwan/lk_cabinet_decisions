  "decision_details": "- The Gampaha district functions as a key supply centre parallel to its rapid population growth and industrialization. As a result, the demand for health services is increasing and the need to establish a national hospital and a Hospital for children has been recognized to meet that demand. Accordingly, it has been planned to establish a national hospital and a hospital for children in the said district under the Public-Private Partnership Methodology. As such, the joint proposal made by the Hon. President and the Minister of Health to acquire two plots of lands in extent of 7 acres and 3 roods in the Grama Niladhari Division of Biyagama North and implement the proposed project after providing basic infrastructure facilities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
