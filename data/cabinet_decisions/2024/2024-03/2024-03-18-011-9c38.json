  "decision_details": "- Many development projects which were initiated at rural level had to be halted, due to the economic issues prevailed in the past few years. However, since the Government has already made a considerable investment for these projects, the said projects should be completed expeditiously and provide the anticipated benefits of the same to the rural community. It has been observed that the amount of provisions allocated under the Decentralized Budget Programme are not sufficient to carry forward the Rural Development Programmes which have already been halted midway in the relevant areas. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to provide allocation of another Rs. 2000 million under the Decentralized Budget Programme to re-implement the Development Projects that had to be halted in the midway at rural level and increase the provisions allocated for Special Development Initiatives of implemented under the supervision of the Presidential Secretariat by another Rs.1000 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
