  "decision_details": "- Since it has been identified that the present resurgence of Sri Lanka's Tourism industry plays a vital role towards the country's economic recovery and growth, it has been proposed through the Budget 2024, a number of steps including the implementation of a long term programme for the promotion of tourism sector and targeting at least 05 million tourists to the country per year. Owing to the multi\u2011faceted nature of the tourism industry and the distribution of various assets, laws and responsibilities among several Government institutions, It is essential to maintain an efficient coordination and collaboration among the relevant institutions to reap the expected benefits. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to establish an Inter-Ministerial Tourism Committee headed by the Secretary to the President with  the representations of the relevant Government institutions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
