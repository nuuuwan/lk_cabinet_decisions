  "decision_details": "- It has been proposed to establish a Faculty of Medicine and offer the MBBS  Degree by the National School of Business Management (NSBM), being a fully self-financed institute owned by the Government, under the direct supervision and monitoring of the  Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and the Sri Lanka Medical Council. It is expected to enroll 500 local and foreign students annually for the said Degree programme. The  NSBM has sought the approval to designate the Homagama Base Hospital as a suitable Government hospital to provide clinical training for those medical students. It has been proposed to formulate a mechanism for allocating the Homagama Base Hospital for the clinical training of the medical students of the NSBM as well as for the Professorial Unit facilities on resources sharing basis, without disrupting to the clinical training of medical students of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, since the approval of the Cabinet has already been granted to utilize the Homagama Base Hospital for the clinical training of the Medical Students of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The NSBM is in agreement to grant necessary funds to develop the  Homagama Base Hospital in conformity with the Standards of the Medical Education published by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to take the Homagama Base Hospital under the purview of the Ministry of Health and upgrade the same as a Teaching Hospital, was approved by the Cabinet.",
