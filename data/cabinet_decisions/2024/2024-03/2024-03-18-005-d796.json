  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Foundation established under the Sri Lanka Foundation Act, No.31 of 1973 functions as a centre for training and awareness services related to sustainable development, social integrity, socio-economic development, good governance, entrepreneurship and democracy. As of now, the Sri Lanka Foundation conducts different courses from certificate level to higher national diploma level and the need has arisen to revise the aims and objectives as well as the powers and functions of the said Foundation so as to suit to the present day requirements. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Mass Media to amend the  Sri Lanka Foundation Act, so as to be able to take action accordingly, was approved by the Cabinet.",
