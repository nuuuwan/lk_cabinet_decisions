  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2023-06-12 to publish the Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman to amend the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, No.34 of 2005 catering to the current needs in the Government Gazette and submit the same in Parliament for approval. However, since the amendments have to be made to a large number of sections in the Act, it deemed appropriate to repeal the current Act in effect and to formulate a new Act under the same title including all the relevant amendments, for the easy understanding of the public. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a new Act enabling to pursue action in that regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
