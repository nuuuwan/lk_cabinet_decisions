  "decision_details": "- A Primary Court, in respect of a dispute affecting land, take only preventive or provisional action pending the final adjudication on title or right to possession which is the function of a civil court. Since a Primary Court order prevails until a final decision is made by a District Court in determining rights and District Court action is subject to two appeals, inevitable delays occur and in this context, even a trespasser or a squatter would be able to remain in possession of the relevant land for an inequitable period of time. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to amend the  Primary Courts Procedure Act enabling to fulfill the objectives expected through section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979  as amended by the Act No. 49 of 1980 more effectively, was approved by the Cabinet.",
