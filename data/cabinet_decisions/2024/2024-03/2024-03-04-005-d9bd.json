  "decision_details": "- It has been decided to implement two (02) floating solar power pilot projects with a capacity of 1 MW each on the surface of the Chandrika Wewa Reservoir and the Kiriibban Wewa Reservoir as per the Record of Discussion signed between the Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology and the Ministry of Power and Energy in Sri Lanka. A request has been submitted seeking each of plots in extent of 0.99 hectares on the water surface of the Chandrika Wewa reservoir located at Embilipitiya Divisional Secretariat and Kiriibban Wewa Reservoir located at Sevanagala Divisional Secretariat and blocks of land in extent of 0.1 hectares each from land reserves of those reservoirs for the activities such as construction of power plants, transmission stations, training of maintenance workers and maintenance of solar panels in relation to those two (02) pilot Projects. The implementation of the proposed Project will enable  a feeding of about 03GWh annual electricity generation into the National Grid. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Irrigation to grant the aforesaid plots on the water surfaces and block of lands to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Sri Lanka on annual lease permits in order to maintain the relevant solar power generation pilot projects, was approved by the Cabinet.",
