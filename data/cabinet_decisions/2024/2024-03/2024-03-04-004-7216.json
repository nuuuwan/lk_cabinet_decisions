  "decision_details": "- \tSri Lanka has also been invited to join the International Counter Ransomware Initiative, which the United States started in 2021 with a group of other countries as a forum to discuss international coordination to combat ransomware. As of now, 48 countries around the world, the European Union as well as the Interpol have joined the said initiative. Since Sri Lanka too has recently faced with negative experiences with  ransomware, it has been recognized that joining the international initiative against ransomware could accrue benefits. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Technology; and the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to join with the international Counter Ransomware Initiative and take further steps in that regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
