  "decision_details": "- The contract for the construction of the Auditorium in the Police Welfare Building has been executed by Interwest Engineering and Construction Company as a sub contract under the project management of the Department Buildings at a total estimated cost of Rs.98.846 million. Arch International (Pvt) Limited has provided consultancy services for the said project. The said project has been suspended by the Department of Buildings on 2023\u201102\u201124 due to the failure of Interwest Engineering and Construction Company to complete the work within the scheduled time period. The Consultancy Services Institution has prepared and submitted a revised total cost estimate of Rs.122.921 million in keeping with the present rates to complete the remaining works of this project. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Security to have the remaining construction works executed through the Department of Buildings under the revised total estimated cost in keeping with the original plan, was approved by the Cabinet.",
