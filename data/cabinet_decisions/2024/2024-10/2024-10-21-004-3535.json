  "decision_details": "- A large amount of scrap metals are annually accumulated in the Department of Sri Lanka Railways and the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the Cabinet approval has been granted at the meeting held on 2024\u201106\u201111 to dispose the currently accumulated scrap metals following the International Competitive Bidding procedure. However, it has been found appropriate to follow the National Competitive Bidding procedure, enabling the local industrialists to offer prices on competitive basis and purchase scrap metal materials, as a solution to the current shortage of raw materials. The proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to pursue action accordingly, was approved by the Cabinet.",
