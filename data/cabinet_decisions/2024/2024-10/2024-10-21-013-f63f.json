  "decision_details": "- A Raid Advance Account is maintained to provide money for the raids carried out by the Commission to \tInvestigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and the maximum limit of expenditure of that advance account is Rs.50 million. Since the amount given as bribe cannot be determined precisely and as per the nature of the bribery complaints received recently, the amount demanded as the bribe is considerably very high, the relevant maximum limit of expenditure should be revised urgently. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to take necessary action to increase the maximum limit of expenditure of Raid Advance Account up to Rs.150 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
