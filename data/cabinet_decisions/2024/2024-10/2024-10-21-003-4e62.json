  "decision_details": "- The Charikarama building located at Wijerama Mawatha, Colombo 07, belonging to the Department of Buddhist Affairs, is used for the accommodation of the Mahanayake Theros when they visit Colombo. Due to the inadequacy of the common facilities of this monastery, the renovation works have been started in the year 2021 under the labor contribution of the Navy. The initial cost estimate has to be revised due to the increase in the price of raw materials in the market and the inclusion of identified additional works. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, National Integration, Social Security and Mass Media to revise the estimate for the relevant renovation works as Rs. 86.97 million and to obtain additional provisions of Rs. 31.86 million required for the year 2024 to the Department of Buddhist Affairs, was approved by the Cabinet.",
