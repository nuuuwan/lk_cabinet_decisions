  "decision_details": "- According to the Public Debt Management Act, No.33 of 2024, a Public Debt Management Office should be established. As per the provisions of section 23 of the said Act, timely, comprehensive and accurate data and information on public debt should be maintained in an appropriate data base. The Government is currently using the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) provided by the Commonwealth Secretariat to record and manage foreign debt, and it is established and maintained in the Department of External Resources. At present, the Commonwealth Secretariat has stopped updating the system and extending the annual license. Discussions regarding the establishment of Public Debt Management Office have been held with the Technical Missions of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and it has been recommended that it is appropriate to use the Commonwealth Meridian software provided by the Commonwealth Secretariat or the DMFAS software provided by the United Nations Trade and Development Organization. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Development, Policy Formulation, Planning and Tourism, to obtain a proposal for the purchase of Commonwealth Meridian software from the Commonwealth Secretariat based on the reasons that the cost-effective, the ease of data migration, the maintenance of data integrity and the integrity between the systems can be confirmed, and to refer the said proposal to obtain the recommendations of a Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
