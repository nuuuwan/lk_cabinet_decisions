  "decision_details": "- At the Cabinet Meeting held on 2023\u201104\u201117, it has been decided not to grant permission to use the Galle Face Green, which is under the management and administration of Sri Lanka Port Management and Consultancy Services (Pvt) Ltd.,a subsidiary company of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, for activities other than religious purposes. It has been observed that it is appropriate to use the Galle Face Green as a more attractive and safe place for local and foreign tourists to roam freely as it was before 2023 and, subject to suitable criteria, for festive events, musical shows and other festivities, which people can participate freely and also to recover the administrative and maintenance cost of the Galle Face Green which is approximately Rs.2.5 to 3.0 million per month. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation, to take necessary action to operate the administration of the Galle Face Green in a more systematic and transparent manner based on the concept, \u201cClean and Green Galle Face Green\u201d, was approved by the Cabinet.",
