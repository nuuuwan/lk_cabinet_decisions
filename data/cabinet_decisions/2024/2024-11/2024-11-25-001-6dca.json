  "decision_details": "- Although the new Parliament was summoned on 2024 11 21, there is no sufficient time to follow the statutorily mandated steps pertaining to the passage of the Appropriation Bill for the year 2025. Therefore, as stated in sub-section 23(1) of the Public Financial Management Act, No.44 of 2024, a Vote on Account should be presented in Parliament for the first 04 months of the year 2025, in order to allocate provisions for continuation of the ongoing projects and for the functioning of the public services. Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, to prepare a Vote on Account for the period of first 04 months of the year 2025, also including the expenses for recurrent expenditure and capital expenditure, public debt servicing and expenditure related to debt restructuring.",
