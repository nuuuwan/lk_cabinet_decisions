  "decision_details": "- Department of Sri Lanka Posts is a network of  654 main post offices and 3,410 of sub post offices while 154 of 654 main post offices are maintained in rented out private buildings. Although a few plots of land have been allotted in several provinces to construct buildings for post offices, the Department has not been able to construct the proposed buildings due to the insufficient funds available. At present, the Department has focused its attention on minimizing the deficit between their income and expenditure, under which the need has been found to identify new income generating sources. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Mass Media to implement multi-purpose projects in the lands allotted for the department under the Public-Private Partnership mechanism in order to secure required accommodation facilities for the Department of Posts as well as to secure an additional income generating source, was approved by the Cabinet.",
