  "decision_details": "- With a view to reducing the use of physical currency in Sri Lanka, action is being taken by the Government in association with all licensed financial institutions to popularize the LANKAQR payment method. As one of its steps, it has been proposed to introduce LANKAQR also for the Manual Toll Collection gates of the Expressways managed by the Road Development Authority (RDA). This will enable the drivers using the Expressways to make the relevant payments within 8-10 seconds by entering the respective amount in his mobile phone and scanning the QR Code at the toll collection gate through a LANKAQR enabled mobile payment app of any Bank. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Highways to implement the said payment mechanism, was approved by the Cabinet.",
