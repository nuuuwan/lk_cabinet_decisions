The total investment value of these projects is Rs. 6899 billion. 95 projects out of which amounting to Rs. 2642 billion in value are new projects commenced in the year 2021 to achieve the goals of the Government Policy Framework \u201cVistas of Prosperity and Splendour\u201d. Under this, projects have been commenced pertaining to the fields of health, education, potable water supply, road network development, improvement of irrigation system and township and rural development. The smooth functioning of these projects has been hampered by the shortage of building materials and labours, restrictions on imports as well as  immigration and emigration due to  the COVID-19 pandemic situation prevailing in the country. Nevertheless, an amount of 63% out of the targeted expenditure of Rs 448 billion has been spent for these projects.
