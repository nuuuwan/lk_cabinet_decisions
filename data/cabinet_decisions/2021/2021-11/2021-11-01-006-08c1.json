Under the said programme it is planned to rehabilitate 1000 tanks/anicuts in the year 2021. Irrigation Department, Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, Mahaweli Consultancy Services Bureau and the Agrarian Development Department function as the implementation institutions of that programme. \u201cWari Saubhagya\u201d programme is expected to be completed within three years and therefore, it has been found appropriate to obtain the services of State institutions and Semi-Government institutions for the purpose.
