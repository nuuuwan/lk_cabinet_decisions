  "decision_details": "- In promoting Sri Lanka as a maritime hub considering its strategic location in the middle of the Indian Ocean, it has been identified the necessity of setting up the legal infrastructure facilities, taking into consideration the international requirements in terms of enacting domestic laws in line with the international treaties and ratifying the international treaties. Previously, a Committee has been appointed under the chairmanship of President's Counsel Mr. P.A. Rathnayake, a former Judge of the Supreme Court to study the related matters and action has not been pursued on the recommendations made by the said Committee. When the damages caused by the accidents of the vessels, MT New Diamond and MV X\u2011Press Pearl within the Sri Lankan waters recently are considered, the necessity of introducing new laws has been highlighted. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Ports & Shipping and the Minister of Justice to appoint a Committee comprising the representatives of the relevant institutions under the chairmanship of President's Counsel Mr. Chandaka Jayasundere, to identify the laws either existing or to be introduced anew or to be amended and submit a Report including recommendations in this regard, also taking into consideration the Report submitted by the former Committee appointed under the chairmanship of Mr. P.
