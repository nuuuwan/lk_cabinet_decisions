  "decision_details": "- The Teaching Hospital, Ratnapura provides its health services to a population of nearly two million living in the Sabaragamuwa Province. Even though cardiology services are already available at the said Hospital, the unavailability of sufficient physical resources for the purpose have led to numerous difficulties. Hence, the proposal made by the Minister of Health to construct a Cardiac Care Complex with the facilities required for the said Hospital and to award the respective contract to the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) on Design, Build and Transfer basis, was approved by the Cabinet.",
