  "decision_details": "- Mediation is now widely accepted in Sri Lanka as a convenient and low-cost mechanism in resolving disputes. The Mediation (Special Categories of Disputes) Act No. 21 of 2003 contains provisions relating to the resolution of disputes which are considered as social and economic issues requiring special expertise and meaningful solutions for the betterment of the community. The said Act empowers the Minister of Justice to appoint mediators with specialized qualifications in considering the nature and the category of the dispute.  It has been identified the necessity to amend certain provisions of the said Act to suit with the present day requirements. Accordingly, the proposal made the Minister of Justice to amend the  Mediation (Special Categories of Disputes) Act No. 21 of 2003 as recommended by the  Civil Law Reforms Sub Committee functioning under the Ministry of Justice and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare an amended draft Bill for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
