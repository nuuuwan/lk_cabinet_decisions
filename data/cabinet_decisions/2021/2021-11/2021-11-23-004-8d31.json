  "decision_details": "- With the increase in volume of traffic, the necessity has arisen to establish a mechanism for the management of traffic on national highways, especially on roads within the City of Colombo. With a view to updating the existing data at the Road Development Authority for the purpose, a request has already been made through the Department of External Resources to seek the assistance of the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).
