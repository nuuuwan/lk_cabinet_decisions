  "decision_details": "- Universal suffrage is an integral part of the people's sovereignty of the Sri Lankan citizens. It should be exercised freely and fairly at an election as people's will. If any candidate, a party or a group spends money lavishly at an election for people's vote with no control, it could considerably affect to the people's choice at elections. The need to have some control over the expenses incurred by the candidates or parties contesting for the elections has been taken up for consideration in Sri Lanka and many countries including India have introduced legislation for controlling election expenses. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E the President to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft amending legislation for the purpose as per the approval granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2017\u201110\u201117 to amend the existing laws to provide for minimizing the illegal activities at elections and taking into account the matters agreed by the Parliament Special Committee appointed to identify the reforms pertaining to the electoral system and laws and submit amendments to the same, in consultation with the relevant parties, was approved by the Cabinet.",
