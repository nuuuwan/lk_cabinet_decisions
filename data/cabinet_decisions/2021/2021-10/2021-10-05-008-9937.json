  "decision_details": "- The Sapugaskanda refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) produces around 70 to 90 Metric tons of LP gas per day which is approximately 5% of petroleum demand of the country. A feasibility study is being conducted to establish a new refinery with the capacity of 100,000 barrels per day as well as to upgrade the existing refinery. Further, plans are also being designed to expeditiously implement such projects. The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has found the significance of entering a third competitor into the LPG market. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Energy to establish a subsidiary company under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation so that LPG business could be commenced using the refinery production, was approved by the Cabinet.",
