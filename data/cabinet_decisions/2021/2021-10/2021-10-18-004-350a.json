  "decision_details": "- The National Port Master Plan of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority has identified the urgent requirement of development of port logistics activities. Accordingly, the Ports Authority has planned to implement a port related logistics section in Bloemendal area. The official quarters of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority in Bloemendal area have to be set up on a suitable land, in the implementation of the said project. A block of land in the extent of 08 hectares in Mahara, Ragama belonging to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority has been maintained as a metal quarry during the period of construction of the Colombo Port and the said land is not being used for any productive purpose. Further, since  the said land is now filled with rain water, it has been identified as suitable to implement a water front development project. Accordingly, it has been planned to develop the said block of land as a Mixed Development Project with residential, urban, cultural, institutional and entertainment facilities. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Ports & Shipping to implement the said project as a Public\u2011Private Partnership Project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
