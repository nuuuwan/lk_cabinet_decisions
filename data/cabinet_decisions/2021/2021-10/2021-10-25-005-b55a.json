  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Customs carries out the containerized cargo inspection at 03 yards belonging to private sector located at Orugodawatta and Grandpass. Due to the limited space and facilities available in those yards, the Officers of the Department of Customs engaged in such activities as well as clients visiting the place are faced with hardships. Further, transportation of containers to those yards causes heavy traffic congestion in the Colombo area. Taking into consideration this situation, a Feasibility Study has been carried out with the technical assistance of the Asian Development Bank to identify the most appropriate place from among the alternative sites of Bloemendhal, Peliyagoda and Kerawalapitiya and accordingly, the block of land in extent of 19 acres and 9.26 perches located in close proximity to the Kerawalapitiya Interchange belonging to the Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation has been identified as the most appropriate place for the construction of the proposed Customs Verification Center. As such the proposal made by the Minister of Finance to take action to allocate the relevant block of land for the said purpose and to take action to establish the proposed Customs Verification Center, was approved by the Cabinet.",
