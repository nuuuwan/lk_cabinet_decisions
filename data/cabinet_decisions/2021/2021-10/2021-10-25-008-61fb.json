  "decision_details": "- The 'Mahaweli Water Security Investment Porgramme' under the Ten Years Financing Facility of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is being implemented as a major investment in the field of irrigated and drinking water under the Medium Term Development Approach of the Government. It has been planned to invest a sum of USD966 million for the project. Under the said project, the construction work of the North Central Maha Ela, North Western Maha Ela, Minipe Maha Ela and the water storage reservoirs of Meegahakirula and Mahakithula are being carried out to meet the acute drinking and irrigated water requirement in the Northern, North Central, North Western and Central Provinces. As such, it is expected to use the excess water stored in the Moragahakanda and Kaluganga reservoirs through the North Central Maha Ela Phase 1 and Phase 2 under construction, for 73,800 hectares of irrigated lands which are capable of cultivating the two seasons in the Northern and North Central provinces and to supply drinking water to 250,000 families. The construction activities which had been planned to be completed within 06 years, now have been planned to be completed within 04 years which is in 2025, as per the Government policy decision. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Irrigation to take necessary action to revise the relevant contract appropriately and accelerate the said construction, was approved by the Cabinet.",
