  "decision_details": "- Section 22 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance has been amended by the Marriage Registration (Amendment) Act No. 12 of 1997 whereby marriage of minors requires the consent of parents accordingly. No party under the age of 18 could contract a valid marriage in Sri Lanka as per In Gunarathnam v Registrar General 2 Sri LR 302. Parental authority or consent to such marriage would be invalid in law. As per the said judgment, it is required to repeal the relevant sections of the laws that authorize the marriage of a minor with the consent of competent authority. Accordingly, action has already been taken to prepare a draft Bill to amend the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act and the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to remove the relevant inconsistencies of the Kandyan Marriage and Divorce Act and to instruct the Legal Draftsman prepare a draft Bill for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
