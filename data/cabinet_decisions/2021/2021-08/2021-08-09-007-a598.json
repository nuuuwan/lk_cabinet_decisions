  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management (SLTHM) which was established under the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005, conducts training courses from foundation level to management level. Although several universities and private institutes conduct courses equivalent to that of the SLTHM at present, those courses are mainly based on theory and there is no possibility yo obtain a sufficient practical training for the required fields through such courses. Therefore, it has been found appropriate to conduct degree courses in the tourism sector also with a sufficient field training by the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism to take necessary action to amend the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005 so as to secure required legal provisions for the purpose and to upgrade the SLTHM in to a tertiary level higher education institute, was approved by the Cabinet.",
