  "decision_details": "- Sri Lankans who had married in Sri Lanka and thereafter reside in overseas have faced with difficulties as decrees given by foreign courts on the matrimonial cases they have field are not recognized in Sri Lanka. Such parties have to file a fresh divorce case in Sri Lanka, if they want to get order for a divorce. As such, the Family Law Advisory Committee appointed by the Minister of Justice has recommended that it would be appropriate to impose legal provisions enabling to recognize foreign divorces, annulments or judicial separations. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to impose legal provisions for the recognition of foreign divorces, annulments or judicial separations in this country, was approved by the Cabinet.",
