  "decision_details": "- Approval has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2021 05 24 to import 120,000 litres of Oxygen monthly to ensure the supply of Liquid Medical Oxygen for the patients with severe COVID 19 conditions. As the number of patients who are being supported with Oxygen has increased due to the outbreak of the new COVID-19 variant, the proposal made by the Minister of Health to import 300,000 litres of Medical Oxygen weekly, in lieu of the 120,000 liters of Medical Oxygen being imported monthly to keep a sufficient storage of Oxygen in the country, was approved by the Cabinet.",
