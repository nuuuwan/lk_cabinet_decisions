  "decision_details": "- The demand on Gems in the International Gem Market has dropped alarmingly, owing to the present COVID 19 pandemic situation which has spread all over the world. Therefore, several requests have been made by Gem industrialists to provide some relief against the fees levied by the National Gem and Jewellery Authority in its Gem export activities and to arrange facilities to conduct online Gem export activities as the aviation services have been disrupted. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Industries, to present the Regulations published in the Gazette Extraordinary Notification No.2232/36 dated 2021 06 18 under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act, No.50 of 1993, to revise the relevant fees and to provide the relevant facilities to conduct online Gem and Jewellery exports, was approved by the Cabinet.",
