  "decision_details": "- It has been recognized that it is appropriate to pay an allowance of Rs.2,000/- to the families whose livelihood have been lost, yet do not receive any allowance from the Government, due to temporary lockdown of the country to control the outbreak of COVID 19. Accordingly, the required funds will be released to the District Secretaries and the relevant allowance will be paid to the selected families by the Divisional Secretaries. The Presidential Task Force for Economic Revival and Poverty Eradication will issue the guidelines required for the purpose. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Finance, to release the additional provisions required for the payment of the said allowance, to the District Secretaries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
