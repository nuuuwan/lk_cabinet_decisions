  "decision_details": "- Due to the improper maintenance of sports complexes and stadiums located countrywide, it has been observed that sportspersons using these grounds have been unable to obtain their expected training. It is essential to maintain well-equipped sports complexes and stadiums especially for talented athletes at the district and provincial levels in order to achieve the anticipated objectives in the field of sports. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Youth and Sports to introduce a proper methodology to maintain those sports complexes and stadiums with participation of the private sector, was approved by the Cabinet.",
