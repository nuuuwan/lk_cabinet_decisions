  "decision_details": "- Efficient and effective operation of all supplies of a country is termed logistics. If the functioning process related thereto could not be operated properly, it would resulted in causing several problems such as increase of the prices of goods thereby making it difficult to control the cost of living. Therefore, declaration of a National Logistics Day has been found appropriate in order to make the public aware on the process related to Logistics. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport to declare the 16th of August as the National Logistics Day from this year onwards and to issue a commemorative stamp to mark the said day, was approved by the Cabinet.",
