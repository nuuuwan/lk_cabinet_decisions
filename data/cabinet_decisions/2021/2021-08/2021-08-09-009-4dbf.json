  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2021 07 19 to amend the sub section 5 of section 60 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No.9 of 2003. It is expected through these amendments to make required legal provisions to control the sale of essential commodities at high prices by certain traders exceeding the control price in particular. The clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman and therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade, to publish the said bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter present the same in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
