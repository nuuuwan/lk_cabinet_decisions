  "decision_details": "- It is mandatory for a seafarer holding a Foreign Maritime Certificate of Competency to obtain an equivalent Certificate (Certificate of Recognition) from the State in which the said ship is registered, to serve in a ship registered under another State. The Merchant Shipping Secretariat has already entered into Memoranda of Understanding with 33 countries pertaining to the acceptance of such Certificates and this has provided employment opportunities for a large number of Sri Lankan seafarers in foreign vessels. Sri Lanka entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the United Kingdom to accept such Certificates in 2007 and both parties have agreed to sign an updated Memorandum of Understanding amending  the provisions of the said Memorandum of Understanding, enabling the Sri Lankan seafarers to have more employment opportunities. Clearance of the Attorney General and the Foreign Ministry has been received for the draft Memorandum of Understanding. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Ports & Shipping to sign the updated Memorandum of Understanding, was approved by the Cabinet.",
