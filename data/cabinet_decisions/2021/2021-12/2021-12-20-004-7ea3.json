  "decision_details": "- With a view to rebuilding the tourism industry affected by the COVID 19 Pandemic, it was decided at the Cabinet meeting held on 2021 01 18 to provide a concessionary period to tourist accommodation providers up to 2021 02 28 to pay electricity bills. However, as the anticipated growth in the tourism field had not been taken place due to the re-transmission of the COVID 19 pandemic since April 2021, taking into consideration the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism, it was decided by the Cabinet to extend the said concessionary period for a further period of two (02) years with effect from 2021 03 01.",
