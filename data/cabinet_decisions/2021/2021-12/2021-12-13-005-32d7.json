This National Park possesses the climatic features similar to those in the Yala National Park and the species inhabitant in both National Parks are also similar. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Wildlife & Forest Conservation to declare the Lunugamvehera National Park as the Yala Zone No. VI, instead of maintaining them as two separate National Parks with similar climatic features, biodiversity and environmental features, was approved by the Cabinet.",
