  "decision_details": "- \u201cAdministrative Unit\u201d is the main criteria used in the classification of  Urban Area. Accordingly, only the Municipal Council and Urban Council have been officially classified as Urban Areas at present. However, due to the weaknesses of the above criteria, many urbanized areas are still identified as rural areas thereby arising the necessity of accurate definition on urbanization. In terms of the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Ordinance No. 13 of 1946 amended by the Act No 49 of 2000, the authority of declaring urban development areas has been entrusted with the National Physical Planing Department. As such, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development and Housing to identify the urban areas located in Pradeshiya Sabha limits in association with Advisory Committee and to declare the urban areas identified within Pradeshiya Sabha limits as recommended by the said Committee, as per the provisions of the Country Planing Ordinance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
