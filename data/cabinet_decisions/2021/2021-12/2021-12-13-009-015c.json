  "decision_details": "- Action has been taken to amend Section 53 of the Penal Code to the effect that the sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded against any person who, in the opinion of the Court, is under the age of 18 years at the time of commission of the offence and enabling to punish the said person by detaining him, during the President's pleasure, in lieu of the said sentence. However, Section 281 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act does not include provisions to the effect that such sentence of death shall not be pronounced on such person if he was under 18 years of age at the time of commission of the offence. Therefore, it has been identified that necessary amendments should be made to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act also, to remove the existing ambiguity. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to amend Section 281 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
