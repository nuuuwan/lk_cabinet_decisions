  "decision_details": "- Due to non implementing the system of maintaining the Household list at present, various issues have arisen on taking action by Grama Niladharis based on the Electoral Registry and other information in issuing Residence Certificates to persons.  The e-Grama Niladhari (eGN) Project has now been initiated under the State Ministry of Home Affairs and a household and citizen database is being prepared under the same. It has been planned to implement the said project under few stages, covering 14,022 Grama Niladari Divisions. The current residency of a person could be clearly verified through that community based database. Accordingly, the proposal made by the H.E the President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence  to recognize the database of the  e-Grama Niladhari (eGN) Project  as the national database in principle  for the requirement of the previous household unit system, was approved by the Cabinet.",
