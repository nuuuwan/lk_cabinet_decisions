  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management (SLITHM) maintains training centres covering the nine (09) provinces island\u2011wide, to provide training to youth in the Hospitality field and for different sectors in the tourism industry. The Kundasale Hotel School governed by the SLITHM, has been set up on a land in the extent of 0.545 hectares in the possession of the Road Development Authority (RDA). Even though the said Hotel School has been constructed in the year 2009 at the cost of Rs.450 million, the SLITHM has not acquired a lawful title to the said land as yet. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism to vest the relevant block of land to the SLITHM as a Grant in terms of the State Land Ordinance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
