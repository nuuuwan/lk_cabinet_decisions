  "decision_details": "- The Government has planned to implement many development projects in the fields of Highways, Irrigation, Buildings and other sectors. However, when considering the capacity of the construction industry and the local construction contractors, it has been observed that implementation of such development projects as expected can be difficult. Under this circumstance, a number of important projects identified are expected to be handed over to the government institutions engaged in construction works for implementation. Accordingly, it has been planned to increase the capacity of the Government owned institutions engaged in the construction related work by procuring and supplying earth moving and construction machinery and equipment, road and building construction machinery and equipment, other equipment related to such activities, pre-fabricated buildings and goods transportation and service supply vehicles and maintenance vehicles required to implement these projects. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Highways to purchase the said machineries by following the relevant procurement procedure under the Supplier\u2019s Credit Facility scheme awarded by such equipment manufactures in collaboration with local counterparts, was approved by the Cabinet.",
