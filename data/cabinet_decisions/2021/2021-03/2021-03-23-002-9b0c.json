  "decision_details": "- 'Gurugedara' Educational programmes are telecast through 'Channel Eye' and 'Nethra TV' covering the subjects from Grade 3 to Grade 13 for continuation of education activities of school students without interruption in face of the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Accordingly, it has been made clear that it would be appropriate to use radio channels to broadcast the educational programs which are being telecast through television, to the areas those are not covered. As it is able to listen to the educational programs through smart phones in addition to the radios while such educational programs are aired through radio, a large number of students are able to listen to those programs. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to broadcast such educational programs through national radio channels and regional radio channels of Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
