  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka has been recognized as the centre of Buddhism and it is a responsibility of the Government to protect and foster Buddhasasana while giving the foremost place for Buddhism. In 1956, the Thripitaka has been printed with sinhala translations to commemorate the Sambudhha Jayanthi of the 2500th year of Buddhist Era. By the Gazette Notification dated 2019\u201102\u201107, Thripitaka has been declared as a National Heritage whereas by the same Gazette Notification it has been prevented the opportunities of revising, making wrong interpretations and translating Thripitaka without the permission of the Government. The proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, to pass an Act for the Preservation of Thripitaka for protecting the same for future generation and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
