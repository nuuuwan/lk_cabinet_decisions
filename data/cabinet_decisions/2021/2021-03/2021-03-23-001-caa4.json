  "decision_details": "- Rearing of giant freshwater prawns in Sri Lanka has been identified as a field that can be improved as a high potential business and provide benefits to the rural fisheries community. As releasing those freshwater prawn fry to the freshwater reservoirs is not carried out in a scientific manner, it has been identified appropriate to conduct a scientific research in this regard. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to implement the said research project between the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka, University of Ruhuna, University of Jaffna, National Aquaculture Development Authority, National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) with the James Cook University of Australia and to enter into a Research Agreement among the said institutes for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
