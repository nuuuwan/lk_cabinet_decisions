  "decision_details": "- It was decided by the Cabinet at the meeting held on 2014\u201107\u201110 to declare 06th April of every year as the National Sports Day of Sri Lanka. However, it is difficult to attract the attention of people towards this day due to the festive season and preparation for the New year celebrations in the country. Since athletes and the entire public should be made aware of and interested in sports by declaring a Sports Day, varied sports related groups have pointed out the necessity of declaring another suitable day as the National Sports Day. Taking into consideration this matter, the proposal made by the Minister of Youth and Sports to declare 31st July, the day Mr. Duncan White won the Silver medal in 400m Hurdles at an Olympics adding a dignity to Sri Lanka, as the National Sports Day, was approved by the Cabinet.",
