  "decision_details": "- It has been scheduled to rehabilitate approximately 5000 tanks/ anicuts under the 'Wari Saubhagya' Program during the period of next 04 years. The Survey Department has informed that the adequate human resources are not available in the Department at present to complete the surveys of such a large number of tanks within period of 03 years. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Irrigation and the Minister of Lands to recruit 70 students who have graduated from Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka or Sir John Kotelawala Defence University and are awaiting for survey training, to the Department of Survey for a period of three years on temporary basis and attach them to the Department of Irrigation with a view to conducting surveys under the supervision of two senior surveyors of the Survey Department, was approved by the Cabinet.",
