  "decision_details": "- The Department of National Botanical Gardens has planed to establish a new Mangrove Botanic Garden in a land in extent of 26.71 hectares in close - proximity to the Pinnaduwa Expressway entrance in Nugaduwa Grama Niladhari division of the Akmeemana divisional secretariat division. Since no institution has so far been in operation including the National Botanical Gardens for ex \u2013 situ conservation of mangrove in Sri Lanka, this Mangrove Botanic Garden will fulfil that requirement. Furthermore, establishment of this proposed Mangrove Botanic Garden will pave the way for the upliftment of the tourism industry and will assist the national and international researches on mangrove species. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism for the establishment of the proposed Mangrove Botanic Garden, was approved by the Cabinet.",
