  "decision_details": "- Approval has been granted by the Appropriation Act No. 7 of 2020 for a borrowing limit of Rs. 2,997 billion for the year 2021. Nevertheless, the borrowing limit approved for the year 2021 had to be increased due to the reasons such as decrease of the government revenue due to the situation that has arisen in the wake of COVID - 19 pandemic, expenses in the health sector and ensuring the social security of those who lost their income, that additional provisions had to be made for the payment of salaries and other expenses of the institutions of which those had been paid by their own income and the increase of expenses in other several areas. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Finance to revise the borrowing limit of Rs. 2,997 billion approved by the Appropriation Act No. 7 of 2020, to Rs. 3,397 billion by Rs. 400 billion and to take necessary action to amend the said Appropriation Bill for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
