  "decision_details": "- The Government of Timor-Leste (East Timor) has conveyed its consent to formally establish diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka. A number of Asian countries including India, China, Japan and South Korea have built up diplomatic relations with the said country at present. Establishing diplomatic relations with the Timor-Leste would be significant in economic and political fronts as well as Sri Lanka's intervention in international platforms to receive its support. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Foreign Minister to develop formal diplomatic relations with that country, was approved by the Cabinet.",
