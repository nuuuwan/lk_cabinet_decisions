  "decision_details": "- The Civil Procedure Code includes provisions pertaining to set aside the judgment given by a court of law upon a request made by a defendant to the court of law with notice to the plaintiff stating that he has reasonable grounds for such default, within 14 days of the decree entered against him for default. It has been observed that by taking advantage of these provisions, it has enabled the defendant to employ delaying tactics and to resist a just claim of the plaintiff. Therefore, the approval of the Cabinet has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2021\u201102\u201101 to amend the section 88(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, enabling to prevent such adverse conditions. Accordingly, the Attorney General has assured that the draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman is in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to present the said Bill in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
