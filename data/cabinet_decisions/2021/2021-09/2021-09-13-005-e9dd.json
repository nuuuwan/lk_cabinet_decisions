  "decision_details": "- The Civil Law Reforms Sub-Committee appointed by the Minister of Justice has recommended that it would be appropriate to introduce to the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101), that it shall not be necessary to adduce formal proof of the execution or genuineness of any deed or document not being a will, which is attested and which on the face of it appears to be duly attested unless in the pleadings or further pleadings the execution or the genuineness thereof is specifically impeached and raised as an issue, or unless the Court requires such proof. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to introduce necessary amendment for the Civil Procedure Code to provide for the said purpose and to prepare draft Bill for the same by the Legal Draftsman, was approved by the Cabinet.",
