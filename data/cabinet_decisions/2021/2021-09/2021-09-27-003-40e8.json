  "decision_details": "- Approximately 3,000 children are born with heart diseases every year and 1,500 \u2013 2,000 out of them require surgical treatment. Although, such children are directed to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital in Colombo from most of the hospitals in the country, the said hospital could only perform nearly 900 surgeries per year according to the facilities available with that hospital. Therefore, until necessary actions are taken to provide adequate facilities for operating theatres and cardiac emergency treatments under the 'Little Hearts' project which is in operation at present, the Rotary International District 3201, India and the Rotary Club of Colombo West, RID 3220 have agreed to implement a project at the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences located in Kochi, India under Rotary funds for a period of two years to facilitate performing serious Cardiac surgeries for children with a view to relieving the congestion associated with Cardiac surgeries. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Health to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Health, Rotary International District 3201, India and the Rotary Club of Colombo West, RID 3220 to implement the relevant programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
