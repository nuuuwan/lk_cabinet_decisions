  "decision_details": "- Since sufficient space is not available in the Republic Building where the Foreign Ministry is presently located, some divisions of the said Ministry are maintained at different other locations outside its main office. Several administrative issues have been encountered owing to this reason. Further, it has been identified the necessity of constructing a building with sufficient space for the Foreign Ministry to suit the present requirements. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers granted its concurrence to the proposal made by the Foreign Minister to get a block of land necessary for the construction of a new building allocated from the land located in Vidya Mawatha, which belongs to the Urban Development Authority and is presently being occupied by the Industrial Technology Institute (ITI).",
