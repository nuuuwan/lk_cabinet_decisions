  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2010\u201109\u201108 to accept the Sign Language as a recognized language. As a considerable number of hearing impaired people reside in Sri Lanka, making provisions to accept sign language as a recognized mode of communication would empower the hearing impaired people, in accessing their educational requirements, legal affairs, health facilities, public and personal services. Accordingly, the need to establish the sign language as a recognized language in Sri Lanka has been identified. Therefore, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Finance to make necessary provisions enabling to accept the sign language as a formal mode of communication by an act of Parliament and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
