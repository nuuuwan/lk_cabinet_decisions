  "decision_details": "- Section 363 of the Penal Code defines Rape as a serious crime and the Penal Code also includes facts relating to the specific offences which fall within the ambit of that crime. However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the law regarding the Statutory Rape. Further, a study conducted by the Medico Legal Society of Sri Lanka has pointed out the need to amend the provisions of the Penal Code relating to the statutory rape.\n\t\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft amending legislation to the Penal Code as suit to the present day requirements, was approved by the Cabinet.",
