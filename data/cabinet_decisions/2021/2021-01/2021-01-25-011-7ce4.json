  "decision_details": "- Kuruwita-Erathna road, one of the three main routes used by Sripada pilgrims to worship Sripada, is used by more than one hundred thousand of pilgrims during a season. Due to the non repairing of naturally formed stairs situated in this lane for a long time, Sripada pilgrims are faced with difficulties.  Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Irrigation and State Minister of National Security, Home Affairs and Disaster Management to take necessary action to repair identified areas of the Kuruwita-Erathna road using the sleepers removed from railway rehabilitation activities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
