  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2017\u201112\u201112 to import coconut kernel, subject to certain conditions, upon the insufficient supply of local coconut production for the coconut kernel based industries. Accordingly, 2,542 metric tons of coconut kernel have been imported during a period of 08 months. However, it has been estimated that there would be a shortage of 250 million nuts during this year. Therefore, the Cabinet decided to grant its concurrence for the proposals made by the Minister of Plantation for taking necessary action to import coconut kernel, subject to the same terms and conditions adopted previously, if the bi-monthly production of coconut remains less than 400 million continuously for 04 months.",
