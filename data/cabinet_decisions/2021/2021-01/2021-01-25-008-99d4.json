  "decision_details": "- The intermittent nature and non-firmness of generation of power through certain renewable energy resources make it technically challenging to add more such energy plants into the main electricity grid. In order to face this situation and store excess generated capacity, it has been identified the necessity of establishing the \u201cPumped Storage Hydropower Plant\u201d. Under the Long Term Generation Plan for the period of 2018 \u2013 2037, it has been identified to operate a Pumped Storage Hydropower Plant in 03 phases from the year 2025 onwards. According to a study conducted in association with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Aranayake area  in the Ma oya Valley and Wewathenna area in Kandy, have been recognized as suitable for the construction of the proposed power plant. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) intends to identify the most suitable place out of those two locations and conduct a comprehensive feasibility study  in this regard.  There is a potential of securing the funds required for the purpose, out of the balance funds of the \u201cGreen Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Project\u201d under the Asian Development Bank. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Power, to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study on the said project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
