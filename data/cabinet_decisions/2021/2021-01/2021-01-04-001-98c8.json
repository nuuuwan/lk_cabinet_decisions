  "decision_details": "- Even though the construction activities of a four storied Advance Training and Administration Building with facilities required for more systematic and efficient operation of the Department Sri Lanka Coast Guard and a five storied Accommodation Building for the purpose of accommodating the Coast Guard Sailors deployed for duty and training have been initiated, the said construction activities have thereafter been suspended as it was decided to transfer the said land to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). However, the said Authority has not yet started any development activity on the said land and those buildings are supposed to be constructed as immediately as possible for the operation and administration activities of the Department of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard. As such, the proposal made by H.E.the President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, to restart the construction activities of the said two buildings as immeidately as possible, was approved by the Cabinet.",
