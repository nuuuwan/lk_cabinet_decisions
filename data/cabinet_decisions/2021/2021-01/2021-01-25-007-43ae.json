  "decision_details": "- The Coconut Cultivation Board, Coconut Development Authority and the Coconut Research Institute have been established under the Coconut Development Act, No.46 of 1971 for the Coconut cultivation, industry and research areas. And, the Kapruka Fund Management Board has been established under the Kapruka Fund Act, No.31 of 2005. Even though the said institutions have been set up for coordinating all functions related to Coconut cultivation regulation, those institutions have failed to provide services to clients at the anticipated level due to inefficient coordination between the said institutions. Taking into consideration the duplication of certain functions discharged by the said institutions and clients having to liaise with several institutions to meet their requirements and incurring of a considerable cost for its maintenance,  it has been decided to amalgamate these 4 institutions into one establishment. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation, to amend the Coconut Development Act, No.46 of 1971, facilitating the amalgamation of the said institutions and setting up of a new institution namely, ''Coconut Cultivation and Allied Industries Development Authority'', was approved by the Cabinet.",
