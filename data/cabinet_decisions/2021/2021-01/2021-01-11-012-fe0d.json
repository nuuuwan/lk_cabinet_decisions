  "decision_details": "- The long period of time taken to follow the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, No.9 of 1950 presently being in force, has caused impediments for various accelerated development activities implemented by the Government. The absence of following an unitary methodology in paying compensation for the lands acquired under the provisions of the said Act and having to spend a lot of time for paying compensation are the leading factors from among them. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Lands to take necessary action to amend the said Act to suit to the present day requirements enabling to acquire lands following a simple procedure and to pay compensation under an unitary methodology accordingly by minimizing the time taken to acquire lands, was approved by the Cabinet.",
