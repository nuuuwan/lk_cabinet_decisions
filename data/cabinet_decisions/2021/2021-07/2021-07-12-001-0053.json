  "decision_details": "- The evidence given by children who become victims of various forms of abuses, pertaining to that incident is more vital in the judicial process. However, Since, such victimized children are faced with various problems in presenting evidence before the court publicly, provisions have been introduced to the judicial system of Sri Lanka by the Evidence (Special Provisions ) Act No. 32 of 1999 to obtain and present such evidence as video recordings. Accordingly, a Video Evidence Recording Unit was set up at the National Child Protection Authority in 2001 and the process of obtaining such evidence is carried out only in Colombo at present. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to establish 09 Video Evidence Recording Units in Hospitals covering the nine (09) provinces in the country, enabling to establish the said facility at provincial level, was approved by the Cabinet.",
