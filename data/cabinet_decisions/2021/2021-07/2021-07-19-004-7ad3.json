  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka Judges' Institute is the sole education institute in the field of Judiciary in Sri Lanka and its contribution for adequate training and capacity building of the judges is not up to the level of satisfaction. In many countries of the world, institutions have been set up and maintained with the facilities similar to the universities, with a view to educating and training judges. The Government has prioritized the promotion of the fields of infrastructure development, legislative reforms and digitization. And also, the necessity of providing required facilities to judges to improve their knowledge and skills has been identified. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to appoint a Committee comprising the experts in the field chaired by Hon. Supreme Court Judge Buwaneka Aluwihare, to obtain recommendations for the establishment of a Judicial Training Academy in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
