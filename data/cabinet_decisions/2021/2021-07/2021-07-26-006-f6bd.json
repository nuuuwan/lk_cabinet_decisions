  "decision_details": "- The National Institute of Education has taken steps to introduce   educational reforms  to create an education system  required to generate competent children to find solutions for the challenges to be encountered in the 21st Century. It has been scheduled to introduce specific changes for curriculum and teaching methods through such reforms. It is expected to introduce the proposed reforms for grades 1,2,6,8 and 10 in the year 2023 and for grades 3,4,5,7 and 11 in the year 2024. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to attach 150 experienced teachers in Teachers' Service in Government schools with the proficiency of the relevant subjects, since the present staff serving in the National Institute of Education is inadequate for the said purposes, was approved by the Cabinet.",
