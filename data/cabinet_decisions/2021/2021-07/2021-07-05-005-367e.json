  "decision_details": "- In the wake of COVID\u201119 pandemic situation, the necessity of continuing the supply of essential food items in the local market without shortage has been identified. It has been observed that specially Red Dhal and White Sugar are sold at higher prices by now in the local market. As a remedy, it has appeared that it is possible to directly import Sugar and Dhal from India and Australia on the intervention of Co\u2011operative sector and sell the same through Lanka Sathosa and Co\u2011operative sales network. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade to take necessary action, was approved by the Cabinet.",
