  "decision_details": "- In terms of the provisions of the Water Resources Board Act, No. 29 of 1964, relevant orders have been published in the Gazette Notification dated 2017\u201103\u201116, to bring the regulations on the monitoring and supervision of activities relating to the control of the excessive use of ground water for commercial purposes and prevention of water pollution under the supervision and control of the Water Resource Board. However, it has been observed that the Water Resources Board Act does not have adequate provisions for imposing penalties for the offences related thereto. Although the Act carries provisions to control the use and possession of illegal drilling machines without being registered under the Water Resources Board, no legal provisions have been made to take legal actions in the case of breach of such orders. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Water Supply to introduce necessary legal provisions required to take action as stated above and to face the challenges encountered by the said board in discharging services, was approved by the Cabinet.",
