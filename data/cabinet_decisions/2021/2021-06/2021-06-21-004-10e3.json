  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act, No.25 of 1991 and the relevant amendments operative at present have provided the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) with the powers only for the regulation of telecommunication. Even though the Legal Draftsman's Department has drafted a basic draft for amending the said Act, the necessity of further amending the said draft to suit the present needs has been recognized. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President in his capacity as the Minister of Technology to draft a Bill to amend the Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment) Act, No. 25 of 1991 incorporating the necessary provisions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
