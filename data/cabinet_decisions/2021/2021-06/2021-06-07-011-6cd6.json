  "decision_details": "- It has been clear that the small and medium scale farmers as well as large scale farmers face a major economic crisis due to the destruction of their products especially, vegetables and fruits for not being able to be transported and traded in a normal way because of the travel restrictions imposed by the Government island\u2011wide. Further, consumers also have faced a scarcity of proper vegetables and fruits at a fair price. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture to implement a Programme to purchase the stocks of vegetables and fruits that could not be sold during the period of travel restrictions, by the District Secretaries/Government Agents at the prices of the District Price Committee and provide the stocks of vegetables and fruits so purchased free of charge, to COVID Treatment Centres, all Government Hospitals, Tri\u2011Forces, Displaced Camps and families who have lost their livelihoods, as found necessary, until the travel restrictions will be lifted, was approved by the Cabinet.",
