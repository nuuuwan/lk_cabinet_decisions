  "decision_details": "- The absence of proper coordination among Line Ministries, other relevant institutions and the representatives of the Industry Sector has caused issues and unnecessary delays in the process of formulation and implementation of policies. Even though there is a possibility of setting up of an Advisory Council on Industries in terms of the provisions of the Industrial Promotion Act, No. 46 of 1990 in view of establishing coordination among the relevant stakeholders, necessary action has not yet been taken for the purpose accordingly. Necessary Action is being taken to amend the Industrial Promotion Act, No. 46 of 1990 incorporating the appropriate provisions to suit the present needs of the Industry Sector. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Industries to appoint Advisory Councils for 20 major industrial sectors comprising the Specialists representing Chambers/Federations in the said sector, Universities and Research Institutions and the Specialists in the relevant Industrial Sector until the said amendments are to be introduced, was approved by the Cabinet.",
