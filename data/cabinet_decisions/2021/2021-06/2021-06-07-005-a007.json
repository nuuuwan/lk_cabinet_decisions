  "decision_details": "- Since the Government has already taken measures to ban the use of chemical fertilizer for Agriculture, it is essential to prepare an appropriate programme for ensuring a sufficient supply of organic fertilizer by increasing the production of the same by the start of the comming Maha season in the month of September. Therefore, a project has been planned to implement an organic fertilizer production project having secured essential fundamental capital from the fund of the Land Reform Commission, so that manufactured organic fertilizer can be purchased by the Ministry of Agriculture and then distribute among the farmers. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Lands to implement the proposed pilot project by establishing at least one organic fertilizer centre at each Divisional Secretariat division covering 29 Divisional Secretariat divisions in the districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa where agriculture is done in abundance by obtaining the required raw materials from the said areas, was approved by the Cabinet.",
