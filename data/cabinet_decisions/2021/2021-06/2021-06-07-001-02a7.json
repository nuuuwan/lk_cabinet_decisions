  "decision_details": "- In the year 2007, a National Cultural Policy has been formulated and Gazetted for the first time. Although approval of the Cabinet was granted in the year 2017 to prepare a National Arts and Cultural Policy by further amending the said National Cultural Policy, actions have not been taken in pursuant with the said decision. Therefore, the need has arisen for a National Cultural Policy as applicable to the present context. Accordingly, the Proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of  Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, to prepare a new National Cultural Policy having further amended the existing policy, and to appoint a committee comprising of expertise of relevant field representing all the cultures, was approved by the Cabinet.",
