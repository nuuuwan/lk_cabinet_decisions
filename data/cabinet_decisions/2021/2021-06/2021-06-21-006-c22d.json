  "decision_details": "- The Regulation of Fertilizer Act No.68 of 1988 has been introduced to regulate the manufacture, preparation, import and distribution of fertilizer and to make provisions for the matters related thereto. Issues have been arisen as certain provisions of the said Act are not adequate and do not meet the present day requirements. Especially, since the necessary action has been taken to implement the use of organic fertilizer throughout the country as per the Government's Policy Statement \u201cVistas of Prosperity and Splendour\u201d, it has been found necessary to include provisions related to that in the said Act. Accordingly,the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture to take necessary action to introduce a new Act in place of the the Regulation of Fertilizer Act No.68 of 1988, incorporating provisions to suit the present day needs , was approved by the Cabinet.",
