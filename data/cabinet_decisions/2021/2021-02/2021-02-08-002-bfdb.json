  "decision_details": "- Regional Trade Agreements and Free Trade Agreements are a key feature in the International Trade and those Agreements have increased in number as well as in complexity over the past few years. Sri Lanka has also entered into such several Trade Agreements and it has been observed that the country could not achieve the expected outcome under some Agreements. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade, to review such Agreements currently under negotiations in order to comply with the National Policy Framework of the 'Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour' and resume negotiations accordingly and, to take necessary action to explore the feasibility of entering into new Regional Trade Agreements and Free Trade Agreements, was approved by the Cabinet.",
