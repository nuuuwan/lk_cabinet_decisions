  "decision_details": "- The requirement of Railway passenger coaches, as at today is approximately 700 and it has been estimated that this could be increased up to 800 over the next 05 years. The available Railway passenger coaches are of various ages, 30% out of which are over 30 years old, 60% are over 25 to 30 years old and 10% have been in service for 12 years or less. 42% of the total Railway passenger coach requirement could be fulfilled by 160 coaches to be received from India and 140 coaches expected to be received from coach repairing project. Therefore, further 50% of total fleet need replacement or rehabilitation early. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport to select an investor adopting the Government Procurement Guidelines to produce 100 Railway passenger coaches with the participation of private sector as a remedy to prevailing situation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
