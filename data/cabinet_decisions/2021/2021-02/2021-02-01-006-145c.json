  "decision_details": "- When conducting an investigation pertaining to an offence under section 135 (4) of the Motor Traffic Act, a Police officer would take charge the relevant driving license and issue a temporary permit. The specimen form relating to that has been published in the Extraordinary Gazette Notification dated 1951\u201108\u201125. Since, the contents in that temporary permit are inadequate at present, the then Minister in charge of the subject of transport issued the Gazette Notification No 2144/19 dated 2019\u201110\u201109 revising the said format to suit with the present requirements. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport to submit the said Gazette Notification to Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
