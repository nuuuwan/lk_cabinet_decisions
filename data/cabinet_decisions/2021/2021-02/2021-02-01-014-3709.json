  "decision_details": "- The Labour Laws do not specify the period of time during which a final ruling should be given having conducted a formal disciplinary inquiry on such allegations in the event of an interdiction upon anti-disciplinary acts or acts of misconduct by Private Sector Employees. As a result, it has been found that in some cases, interdicted employees face various economic and social difficulties. Therefore, the Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Minister of Labour to amend the Industrial Disputes Act No.43 of 1950 incorporating provisions for the issuance of a final disciplinary order within 6 months from the date of interdiction of an employee and to pay half of the wage provided that the misconduct is not a financial fraud.",
