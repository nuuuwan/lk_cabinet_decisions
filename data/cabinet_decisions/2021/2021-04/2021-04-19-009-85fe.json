  "decision_details": "- Even though Dairy Entrepreneurs Societies registered at district and provincial levels operate in view of encouraging the entrepreneurs engaged in dairy farming, there does not exist a common organization consisting of all dairy entrepreneurs societies that operates under the Government sponsorship. Therefore, in taking action for the upliftment of dairy industry, the necessity has arisen to register the Dairy Entrepreneurs Societies within single legal framework at regional, district, provincial and all island levels under such common structure. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill for registration of Dairy Entrepreneurs Societies for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
