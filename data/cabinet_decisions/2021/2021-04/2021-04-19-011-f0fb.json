In view of resolving this issue, various countries have already taken action to enact laws. Actions have to be taken to provide an opportunity to the citizens and civil society for access to accurate information by introducing a new law for protection of the society from harms caused due to online falsehoods. As such, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Mass Media to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
