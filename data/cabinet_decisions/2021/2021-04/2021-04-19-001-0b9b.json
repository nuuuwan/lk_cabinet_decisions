  "decision_details": "- Creation of globally competitive professionals equipped with competencies has been identified as a timely requirement in order to enhance the quality of highly demanding professions in the job market. Only about 20% out of the students who passed G.C.E. (A/L) and qualified for universities, get opportunities to enter into the state universities for studies and inclination of the rest of students towards the vocational education is not at a considerable level. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to establish City Universities as universities awarding degrees to suit with employment opportunities developing skills required for the production sectors in the relevant Districts and to get provided necessary legal provisions for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
