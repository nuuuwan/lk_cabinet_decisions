  "decision_details": "- In line with the development needs in 1960s, the Hardy Institute of Technology has been set up as a Technical Training Institute to provide systematic engineering knowledge to the Technical Officers aiming the Galoya Development Project, the first multipurpose reservoir project of Sri Lanka. Subsequently, the scope and the structure of the said Institute has been changed at many occasions and at present, it functions as two separate institutes such as Hardy Technical College, offering National Diploma (NVQ - 5 Level) and Higher National Diploma (NVQ - 6 Level) to provide those who have missed the mainstream higher education with alternative higher education opportunities and as Hardy Advanced Technological Institute established under  Sri Lanka Institute of  Advanced Technological Education  conducting NDT Agricultural Programme which was conducted by the said Hardy Technical College earlier. Since it has been identified that the structure and the course content are required to be changed in order to create entrepreneurs enriched with high technical knowledge assisting to expedite the economic development  and expand the economy according to the economic programmes of the present Government, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to establish an independent institution named \u201cHardy Institute of Technology\u201d combining the said two institutions and to amend the relevant Acts for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
