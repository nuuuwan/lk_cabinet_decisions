  "decision_details": "- To lead an efficient social life by sharing ideas, existing facilities for Sri Lankan youth community to find solutions through negotiations for their educational, health, civil and political issues are inadequate. Specially, the opportunities and the locations available at divisional level for organizing and engaging voluntarily in such activities are very limited. As a remedy to this situation, it has been identified that it would be appropriate to create suitable locations for youths to gather at a familiar environment and to engage in productive activities by sharing experiences. For this purpose, it has been planned to identify the underutilized government schools and other buildings with sufficient spaces at divisional and district level and launch a programme to establish High Impact Youth Community Centres creating multiple opportunities and activities. It is also expected to construct Youth Community Centres in each Divisional Secretariat Divisions of the country within five years implementing as public private joined project and facilitating for various activities within 04 zones such as Youth Development Zone, Youth Entertainment Zone, Economic Zone, and Green Zone in the same centre. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Youth and Sports to implement the said programme at phase out level and to establish 25 centres covering all districts as the first phase of the project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
