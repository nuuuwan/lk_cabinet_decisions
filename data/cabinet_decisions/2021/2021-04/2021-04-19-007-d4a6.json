  "decision_details": "- In terms of Article 9 in Chapter II of the Constitution, one of the main responsibilities of the Government shall be the protection and fostering Buddhasasana while giving the foremost place to Buddhism. It has been apparent that  various books, publications, Compact Discs (CDs) and other productions emerge distorting the pure Buddhism and Buddhist traditions. Therefore, it has been observed that it would be appropriate to enact an Act incorporating the provisions for regulation of such productions. As such, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious & Cultural Affairs to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill for regulating the publication of Buddhist publications, was approved by the Cabinet.",
