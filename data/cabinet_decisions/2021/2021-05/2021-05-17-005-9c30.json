  "decision_details": "- \tThe Government Policy 'Vistas of Prosperity and Spelndour' has proposed to increase the total forest layer of the country up to 30%. Accordingly, 'Surakimu Ganga' National Environment Conservation Programme and 'Husma Dena Thuru' Tree Planting Programme are being implemented under the Ministry of Environment, through a number of stakeholders including Government Institutions, Private Sector, Non-Government Organizations (NGOs') and Voluntary Organizations islandwide. In view of meeting the sapling need of the said programmes and creating green entrepreneurs while encouraging the rural community, it has been planned to generate 650 new plant nursery operators all over Sri Lanka. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Environment to provide a formal training to 650 low\u2011income families to be selected under the said programme as nursery plant operators and grant opportunity to function as green entrepreneurs, was approved by the Cabinet.",
