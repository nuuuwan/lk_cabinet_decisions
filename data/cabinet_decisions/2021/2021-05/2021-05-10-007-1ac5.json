  "decision_details": "- Any good imported for any project with an investment of 50US$ million or more which implemented on 2019\u201103\u201106 or later has been exempted from CESS prior to the commencement of the commercial operations of that project. However, since some large scale projects commence its commercial operations in stages before the completion of the entire project, the relevant provisions for CESS exemption have not been made available for such projects. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade to submit the Gazette Notification No.2219/36 dated 2021\u201103\u201117 published under Sri Lanka Export Development Act No. 40 of 1979 imposing the provisions for CESS exemption of such projects as well, in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
