  "decision_details": "- A migrant worker insurance coverage had been made by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment for Sri Lankan migrant workers and compensations will paid through this cover subject to a maximum of Rs.600,000/-and Rs.400,000/- respectively in the event of death or permanent disability of a migrant worker. However, it does not provide any insurance coverage for industrial or domestic accidents caused, diseases and also for taking medical treatments for mental and health issues caused due to harassment or abuses by employers and for the loss of jobs due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore,  the proposal made by the Minister of labour to introduce a suitable insurance coverage for Sri Lankan migrant workers taking into consideration the above facts, was approved by the Cabinet.",
