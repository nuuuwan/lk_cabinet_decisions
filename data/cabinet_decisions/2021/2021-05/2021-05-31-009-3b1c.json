  "decision_details": "- The Sri Lanka Police Headquarters which is presently maintained in 03 buildings of more than 100 years old has been constructed in a land located in between the York Street and the Chethiya road. Since the building premises is not spacious enough, civil administration office and several other divisions of the Police Headquarters are maintained at rented out buildings. Although, the approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2011\u201107\u201111 to construct the Police Headquarters Complex at Mirihana, necessary measures have not been taken accordingly. Under these circumstances, the land in extent of 14 acres 02 roods and 38.50 belonging to the Sri Lanka Police at No 142, Bellantota Junction, Attidiya Road has been found suitable to construct the Police Headquarters Complex. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Security to construct the Police Headquarters Complex in the said land belonging to the Sri Lanka Police instead of constructing in Mirihana  and to identify the required buildings as separate projects according to the requirements and carry out relevant procurement procedures, was approved in principle by the Cabinet.",
