  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that certain vehicle importers get a special advantage by registering the imported mobile workshops as dual purpose vehicles. Taking into account the recommendations made by the Committee on Public Accounts to that effect, Regulations to introduce a new Harmonized System Code (HS Code) to levy equal duty on mobile workshops and dual purpose vehicles and to allow to import them based on equal lifetime, have been published in the Gazette Notification dated 2020\u201104\u201123 as per the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Finance to submit the Regulations so published in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
