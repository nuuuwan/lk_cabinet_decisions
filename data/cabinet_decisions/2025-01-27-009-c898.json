It has been found as appropriate to determine the functions and powers of the Land Use Policy Planning Department through an Act of Parliament in order to create a legal background for the more effective implementation of the functions of the Department. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill containing provisions for that purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
