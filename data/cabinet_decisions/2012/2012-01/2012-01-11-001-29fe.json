  "decision_details": "- Cabinet approval has already been granted for foreigners visiting Sri Lanka to obtain visas through the internet.   Exemption of children under 12 years of age from charging processing fees would make this system attractive while boosting visits of foreigners with their families.  It would also be very favourable for Sri Lanka, if transit passengers are given exemption from processing fees up to two (02) days (48 hours), as on numerous occasions they conclude their visits within that period of time.  The above proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence and Urban Development, was approved by the Cabinet.",
