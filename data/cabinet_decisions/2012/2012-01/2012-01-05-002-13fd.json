  "decision_details": "-  The Government has observed the economic difficulties that are being faced by the people due to law's delays and pending legal cases. With the view to overcome this situation, a system of judicial mediation is to be introduced as a first step in Court proceedings and pre-trial procedures are to be adopted thereafter. Judicial mediation will endeavor to bring about an amicable settlement on the issues concerned  between the relevant parties. The proposal made by Hon Rauff Hakeem, Minister of Justice, was referred to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Legislation for its recommendations.",
