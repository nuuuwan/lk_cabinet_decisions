  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka being a developing island nation subject to tropical climate patterns, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Extreme weather events such as high intensity rainfall, flash floods and landslides and extended dry periods resulting in water scarcity are now becoming common occurrences in Sri Lanka.  As such, urgent measures are necessary to face the adverse impacts of climate change. The National Climate Change Policy of Sri Lanka developed through a series of consultations with the main stakeholders and on public comments received, will provide guidance and directions for all stakeholders  to address this situation efficiently and effectively. The proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Minister of Environment, for the implementation of the proposed National Climate Change Policy of Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
