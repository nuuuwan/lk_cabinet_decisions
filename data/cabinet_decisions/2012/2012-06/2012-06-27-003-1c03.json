  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka is highly dependent on imported petroleum products to meet its energy requirements.  As a result of  rising oil prices in the world market as well as the local demand for petroleum product, Sri Lanka's oil bill  during the recent years shows a substantial increase.  To address this issue and to assess the country's energy situation and also to formulate a programme to achieve immediate, medium and long term energy security, Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to the proposal made by Hon. Susil Premajayantha, Minister of Petroleum Industries, to appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee, to be assisted by an Inter-ministerial Senior Officials' Committee consisting of representatives of the relevant Institutions to make early recommendations to the Cabinet in this regard.",
