The proposal made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage to establish a subsidiary company fully owned by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board to carry out the production and distribution of bottled/containerized safe drinking water targeting the affected areas, was approved by the Cabinet.",
