  "decision_details": "- It has been observed that the tourism industry is developing rapidly due to the peaceful environment established in the country at present and watching Marine mammals including whales is also increasing.  It has therefore become highly essential to formulate regulations to handle mammal watching activities in a regular manner with proper management.  The regulations to be framed are intended to ensure the peaceful and natural existence of all sea mammals whose natural habitat is within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka; and assist the regulation and control of vessels used by visitors for the purpose of observing such sea mammals. The proposal made by Hon. S.M. Chandrasena, Minister of Agrarian Services and Wildlife, to publish the regulations prepared by the Legal Draftsman, in the Government Gazette and to present those thereafter in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
