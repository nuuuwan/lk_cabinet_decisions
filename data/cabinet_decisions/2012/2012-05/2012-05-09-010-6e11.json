  "decision_details": "- location of Sri Lanka is such that it is exposed to severe thunderstorms and intense lightning than many other countries in the world.  With the rapid development of the country, the use of delicate electrical and electronic equipment too has increased and these are vulnerable to both direct and indirect effects of lightning.  Many developed countries have taken steps to mitigate this vulnerability which has resulted in minimizing the damage caused to lives and properties. The proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Disaster Management to establish a National Centre for Lighting Safety, under the Department of Meteorology with an Interim Committee of Officials headed by the Director General of Meteorology to manage the Centre, until such time proper legislation is framed for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
