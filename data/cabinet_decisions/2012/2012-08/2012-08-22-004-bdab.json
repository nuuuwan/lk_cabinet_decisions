  "decision_details": "- the Ozone layer is situated 20-50 Km. above the earth's surface and acts as a protective shield and filters the harmful ultra-violet radiation coming from the sun.  When Ozone Depleting Substances are released to the atmosphere they destroy the Ozone layer, which would lead to, increasing the risk of having skin cancers, eye cataracts etc.  as well as global climate change.  In keeping with the Montreal Protocol, Sri Lanka is obliged to completely phase out chlorofluorocarbon which is widely used in refrigeration and air conditioning. The proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharashana Yapa, Minister of Environment, to implement the recommendations made by the Officials' Committee to start the control of the import/export and production of Hydrochlorofluorocarbon with effect from 01st January 2013, and stop such activities by January 2030 on phased out basis and to direct the Controller of Imports and Exports to introduce appropriate regulations for the purpose under the provisions of the relevant Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
