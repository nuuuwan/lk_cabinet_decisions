  "decision_details": "- presently the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment has 07 regional centres and 25 district and other training centres.  These centres provide various services to persons to go abroad for employment purposes. With the view to providing better training facilities to migrant workers, it has been proposed to construct well designed Migrant Resource Centres with all necessary facilities, including residential training, particularly in District Capitals. A resource centre is presently under construction at Tangalle, with funds generated by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, and is due to be completed by the end of July 2012. Another Resource Centre with hostel facilities for 200 females is to be constructed at Ratnapura at a total cost of Rs.274 million. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment will make arrangements to utilize vacant Government buildings to provide these training facilities to migrant workers in other District Capitals, in association with the Vocational Training Institutes of the Government.  The above proposal made by Hon. Dilan Perera, Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, was approved by the Cabinet.",
