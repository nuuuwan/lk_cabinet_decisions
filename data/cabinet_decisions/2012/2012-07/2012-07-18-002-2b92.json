  "decision_details": "- taking into account the need to promote the development of new varieties of plants in Sri Lanka and the protection of the rights of the breeders and farmers against misuse, the enactment of new legislation for the purpose has been found essential. Since the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act No.36 of 2003 do not cover the protection of the rights of the breeders of new plant varieties and of the farmers, the joint proposal made by Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, Minister of Industry and Commerce and Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Minister of Agriculture, to refer it to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on legislation for its recommendations, was approved by the Cabinet.",
