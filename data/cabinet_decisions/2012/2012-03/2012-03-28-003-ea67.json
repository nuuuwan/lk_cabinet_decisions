  "decision_details": "- the Ozone layer is situated 20-50 Km. above the earth's surface and acts as a protective shield and filters the harmful ultra-violet radiation coming from the sun.  When Ozone Depleting Substances are released to atmosphere they destroy the Ozone layer, which would lead to, increasing the risk of having skin cancers, eye cataracts etc.  as well as global climate change.  In keeping with the Montreal Protocol, Sri Lanka is obliged to completely phased out chlorofluorocarbon which is widely used in refrigeration and air conditioning. The proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharashana Yapa, Minister of Environment, to appoint an Officials' Committee to examine and submit recommendations to control the import/export and production of Hydrochlorofluorocarbon with effect from 01st January 2013, was approved by the Cabinet.",
