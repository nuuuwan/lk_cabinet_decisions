  "decision_details": "- in keeping with the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act, regulations pertaining to violation of seat belt regulations have already been gazetted by the Minister in-charge of the subject of Transport.  These regulations provide for the imposition of a fine not less than Rs.1000/- and not exceeding Rs.2000/- on the first occasion, to a fine not less Rs.2000/- and not exceeding Rs.3000/- on the second occasion, and to a fine not exceeding Rs.3,500/- and cancellation of the driving license on the third occasion, on conviction after a summary trial in a Court of Law.  Since it has been observed that the general public is inconvenienced, in that they are compelled to appear in Courts for such offenses, the proposal made by Hon. Kumara Welgama, Minister of Transport, to amend Section 157A(4) of the Motor Traffic Act, to enable spot fines to be imposed in similar manner, against drivers and passengers traveling in the front seat of vehicles who contravene such regulations, instead of convicting them after a summary trial in a Court of Law, was approved by the Cabinet.",
