  "decision_details": "- the modern telecommunication infrastructure is an essential requirement for rapid economic and social development of the country and at present 9 Public Switched Telecommunication Net-work Operators are providing telecommunication services in Sri Lanka and more than 2900 antenna structures have been installed to facilitate the provision of such services.  Considering the environmental and health related public concerns for human safety issues that arise when engaged in the construction of antenna structures and installation of net-works in public places, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka has established a Technical Advisory Committee to assist the regulatory process on construction of antenna structures.  The proposal made by H.E. the President to implement the National Policy on Antenna Structures prepared by the said Committee and to issue guidelines in this regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
