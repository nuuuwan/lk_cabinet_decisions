  "decision_details": "- As a measure to avoid the shortcomings that led to the European Union ban on the export of fish products from Sri Lanka, the penalties for the illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing have been increased in compliance with international standards and proportionate to the gravity of the infringements. Due to stringent nature of the penalties, the authorized officers who engaged in the  implementation of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act, including the officers of the Navy and the Police who engaged in raids and arrests under the Act, have to face many obstructions and threats. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, to amend the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act to increase the present fine of Rs.25,000/- up to a minimum of Rs.50,000/- and enabling the increase of such fine, based on the length of the fishing vessel, for the obstructions made to the authorized officers when they implement the powers vested on them under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act and to recognize the officers of the Coast Guard also as authorized officers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
