  "decision_details": "- The annual requirement of Soya Bean in Sri Lanka is around 220,000 MT and the average annual production of Soya Bean in the country is around 22,500 MT.  Therefore, high priority has been given by the Government to enhance the production of Soya Beans.  As such, during the Yala Season of 2016, Soya Bean has been cultivated in about 4,000 ha, giving priority to the Mahaweli Zones and the Anuradhapura District and the anticipated harvest from that is about 8,000 MT.  With a view to protecting the local farmers and promoting supplementary food crop production, the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to purchase about 5,000 MT. of the said anticipated harvest from farmers and issue to the Thriposha Production Programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
