  "decision_details": "- In a backdrop where there is a steady escalation of traffic congestion in the city, it has been identified that a rapid and economical transportation service based on reservoirs and canals could be provided for the areas where bus or railway transportation services are inadequately deployed.  Therefore, using the existing canal system and sea, an efficient transportation service that links the East-West and North-South areas of Colombo, could be provided.  Accordingly, three inland water transport lines, namely Wellawatta - Battaramulla (through the canals), Fort - Union Place (along the Beira Lake) and Mattakuliya - Hanwella (along the Kelani River) have been identified by the Megapolis Transport Committee as potential routes for the purpose.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to carry out a feasibility study with regard to the construction of an Inland Water Transport System under a Private\u2011Public Partnership system, identifying a suitable private investor, was approved by the Cabinet.",
