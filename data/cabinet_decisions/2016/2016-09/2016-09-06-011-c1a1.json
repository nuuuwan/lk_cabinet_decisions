  "decision_details": "- Maduru Oya Reservoir constructed in the year 1982 is one of the major reservoirs constructed under the Mahaweli Accelerated Development Progrmme.  It was expected through the above reservoir to develop 39,000 ha of land in the Mahaweli System 'B' based on the districts of  Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa, for agricultural purposes. Although, the Maduru Oya Left Bank development activities were initiated and completed, the development of the Right Bank area has not been implemented so far due to the inadequacy of the financial provisions.  Accordingly, with a view to expediting the supply of drinking water, provision of irrigation water and development of infrastructure facilities for the socio\u2011economic development in the districts of Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa, where development had stalled due to the impact of prolonged conflict, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to implement the Maduru Oya Right Bank Development Project during the period of 2017-2020, was approved by the Cabinet.",
