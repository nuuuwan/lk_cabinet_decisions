  "decision_details": "- The Divisional Secretariat, Panadura belonging to the Kalutara District, consists of 72 Grama Niladhari Divisions with a population of about 205,969. Since there is insufficient space in the buildings where the Divisional Secretariat is housed, the people who daily visit the office to  receive services and also the staff of the office have to undergo many difficulties. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Vajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Home Affairs, to construct a new building for the Divisional Secretariat, Panadura, with the necessary facilities, at an estimated cost of Rs.172.8 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
