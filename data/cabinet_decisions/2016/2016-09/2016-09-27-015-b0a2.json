  "decision_details": "- The main road of 11.1 km long running from Gajabapura, Welioya to the Nedunkerni Town, is the shortest route  available for the people living in Welioya, Mullaitivu District, to access the Mullaitivu Town, which is the main town of the  district. The development of this road, which is highly dilapidated at present, would ease the daily life of the people living in the Welioya area. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to improve this road, at an estimated cost of Rs.466.3 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
