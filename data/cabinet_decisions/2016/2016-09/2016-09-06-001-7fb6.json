  "decision_details": "- Asbestos is used for numerous products such as roofing sheets, floor tiles, cement pipes, brake pads of vehicles, paper and ropes. The importation of blue asbestos (Crocidolite) to Sri Lanka, which was identified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO),  has been banned since the year 1987 and by now all types of asbestos, including white asbestos (Chrysotile) which is most commonly used in Sri Lanka, have been identified as carcinogens by the WHO.  Around 80% of the white asbestos imported to Sri Lanka is used to manufacture roofing sheets.  Accordingly, with a view to minimizing the adverse effects caused to health through asbestos and improving public health, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to move towards cost effective substitutes and limit  the import, use and production of asbestos related products from 01-01-2018 and to formulate an action plan to totally ban the production of asbestos related products in the country by 01-01-2024,   was approved by the Cabinet.",
