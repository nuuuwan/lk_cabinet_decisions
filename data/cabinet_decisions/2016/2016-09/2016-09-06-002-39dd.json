  "decision_details": "- The use of plastic and polythene related products is a common occurrence  in present day society and as such, a number of social, environmental, health and economic issues have emerged due to the improper use,  disposal and burning of such products.   The per capita use of plastic and polythene in Sri Lanka is approximately 0.5 kg per day and around five (05) lakhs of tonnes of polythene is imported to Sri Lanka annually.  Certain countries in the world have totally banned the use of polythene while some other countries have allowed the use of only  selected types of plastic material.  Taking into consideration, matters such as the need to control the adverse environmental effects caused due to the addition of plastic and polythene related products that take a long time to decay, to the environment as well as the engagement of a large number of employees in plastic and polythene related industries, the proposal made by  H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, for the appointment of a Committee of Experts to formulate a National Policy and an Action Plan pertaining to the use of polythene, plastic and biodegradable plastic in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
