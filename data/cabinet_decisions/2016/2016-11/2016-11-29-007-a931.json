  "decision_details": "- The National Lotteries Board contributes a large sum of money to the Consolidated Fund of the Government but its head office is housed in a  building obtained on annual rental basis at a cost of Rs.17.5 Million.  The space available in the building is also inadequate to conduct the operations of the organization. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance, to construct a new building for the National Lotteries Board in the land owned by the Board in Vauxhall Street, Colombo 02, was approved by the Cabinet.",
