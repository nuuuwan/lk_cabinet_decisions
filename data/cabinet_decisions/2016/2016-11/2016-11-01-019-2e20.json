  "decision_details": "- The Nila Sevana Housing Project commenced in the year 2003, to provide houses at an affordable and reasonable price with special focus on public sector employees. However, the construction work of the 576 apartments planned to be constructed at Habaraduwa, in the Galle District, under this programme has not been carried out since 2011.  As a result, the premises in extent of 13 acres where the housing units are to be constructed and the 09 buildings therein, remain in a state of severe dis- repair.  Hence, it has been proposed to develop the land and renovate the buildings therein, so as to contain all modern amenities to enhance the value of the premises changing its scope as a mixed project for both residential and tourist objectives.  Accordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Malik Samarawickrama, the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade; and Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the Minister of Public Administration and Management, to sign a supplementary Agreement to the tri\u2011partite Agreement entered into between the Ministry of Public Administration and Management, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and the Project Company, enabling the provision of some of the housing units to be allocated to the public officers on concessionary terms and the rest for accommodation purposes of both the local and foreign tourists, was approved by the Cabinet.",
