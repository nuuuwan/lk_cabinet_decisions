  "decision_details": "- The Talangama Police Station covers 240 Grama Niladhari Divisions and serves a population of 170,000.  It is situated in a small plot of land of 44 perches in extent along a internal road away from the main road.  Due to this reason, the Police Officers serving in the Police Station and as well as the people who come for services to the Police Station have to undergo much difficulties.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to transfer a land of one acre in extent at the Parliament Road, Battaramulla, owned by the Urban Development Authority, to the Ministry of Law & Order and Southern Development for the establishment of the Talangama Police Station, was approved by the Cabinet.",
