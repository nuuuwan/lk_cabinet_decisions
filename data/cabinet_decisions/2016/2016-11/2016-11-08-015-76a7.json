  "decision_details": "- Although, it was planned to initiate the development activities in the year 2008 of the Peradeniya Police Station which is housed in an area, where there is a large local as well as foreign population, the construction work has not been carried out so far due to various reasons.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayake, the Minister of Law & Order and Southern Development, to launch the project for constructing a state-of-the art Police Station at Peradeniya to suit the present day needs, at an estimated cost of Rs.141 Million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
