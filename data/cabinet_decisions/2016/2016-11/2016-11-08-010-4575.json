  "decision_details": "- At present, in addition to legal assistance, counselling and medical services required for the women victims of violence in cases of domestic violence, rape and to sex trafficking, the need to maintain temporary shelters which provide relief for such women victims has also emerged.  The first shelter for women victims of violence  was established by the Government of Sri Lanka in the year 2012 and subsequently, several such centres have been established on a regional level. Further, such temporary shelters are maintained at private premises as well, with the assistance of government hospitals, the Police and Non-Government Organizations. As such, the Cabinet granted its approval for the Guidelines submitted to the Cabinet by Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara, the Minister of Women and Child Affairs, for the maintenance of such shelters to provide protection for women who become victims of violence due to various reasons.",
