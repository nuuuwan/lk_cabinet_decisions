  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet has granted approval for the establishment of two Regional Consular Offices of the Foreign Ministry in Matara and Vavuniya.  However, having taken into consideration, the matters pointed out by the Political Authority of the Northern Province that it is the people of the Jaffna District who constitute mostly of those who regularly seek consular assistance and with the objective of providing the consular assistance to a larger sector of the people living in the Northern Province, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, for the establishment of the Regional Consular Office in Jaffna instead of Vavuniya, where it was scheduled to be established earlier, was approved by the Cabinet.",
