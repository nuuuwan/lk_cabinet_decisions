  "decision_details": "- The concessionary period of 03 months granted by the Cabinet for registration of transfers at the time of change of possession of motor vehicles subject to a surcharge is due to expire on 2016-11-30.  Therefore, due to a large number of persons coming to the department for registration of transfer of these vehicles a great congestion has been created, presently, in the official functions of the department.   As such, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to extend the concessionary period by a further one month up to 2016-12-31, was approved by the Cabinet.",
