  "decision_details": "- With the increase of transport of goods via oceans, the damages caused to ships have been increased and the International Convention on the accountability of Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage came into force in the year 2008, in order to provide adequate and prompt compensation to the parties who suffer from the damages caused by spills of bunker oil and minimizing the damages to marine associated industries.  Presently, 80 States are parties to the convention.  Since around 5,000 ships anchor at the Sri Lankan Ports annually, and a large number of ships traverse daily on the International Naval Route located in the Marine Zone of Sri Lanka, the risk of having bunker oil spills within the Marine Zone of Sri Lanka is very high.  In  order to minimize possible damages caused to the fisheries, tourism and other industries related to the marine environment, it is appropriate to sign this convention in order to obtain the compensation expeditiously. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, and adopt the International Convention on the accountability of Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage to amend the Marine Pollution Prevention Act, No.35 of 2008, to make provision to implement the said Convention, was approved by the Cabinet.",
