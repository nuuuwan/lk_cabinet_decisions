  "decision_details": "- Most of the Buddhist temples in the Northern and Eastern Provinces can be identified as un-accesible temples with very low facilities.  Facilities for drinking water and the essential sanitary facilities in these temples are at a minimum level, in view of the limited number of families with the ability to support, the temples do not possess the financial capacities to upgrade these facilities.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Buddha Sasana, to implement a project for improving the sanitary facilities (toilet facilities etc.) in 100 selected temples with inadequate facilities situated in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, utilizing the Rs.20.25 Million donated by Rev. Ming Sheng, the Chairman of the Buddhist Association in the Gwandoon area  of China, was approved by the Cabinet.",
