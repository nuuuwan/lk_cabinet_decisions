  "decision_details": "- Matara General Hospital provides health services to around half of the indoor patients in the Matara District. It is situated in the city centre of the Matara town within a small area where expansion is limited and hence, heavily congested.  As such, attention has been focused over making use of the Korea - Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital in Godagama for the purpose for which a proposal has already been drawn up to establish the Maternal and Infant Care Unit of the Matara General Hospital, in the Korea - Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital in Godagama, Matara.  Accordingly, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, made the Cabinet aware of the arrangements made to obtain a grant of US$ 8.5 Million from the Korean International Cooperation Agency for the establishment of a new ward complex for this purpose, at the Korea - Sri Lanka Friendship Hospital in Godagama, Matara.",
