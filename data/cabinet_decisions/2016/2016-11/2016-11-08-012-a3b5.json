  "decision_details": "- The elections of the Pudukuduirippu and the Maritimepattu Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Mulativu District was scheduled to be held on 2011-03-17  but due to various reasons, the elections had to be postponed from time to time.  Although, the elections were postponed, the nominations submitted are in force even by now.  Hence, a necessity for re-calling nominations, has arisen due to demise of the candidate who have submitted nominations or the candidate exceeding the age of 35 years who when submitting nominations was below the age of 35 years. Further, the elections of the above local authorities should be held under the proportional representation system that existed then, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Act.  However, it is observed that holding elections for these two local authorities would be appropriate under the mixed system of elections, since the delimitation activities of the wards of Local Authorities are almost at the final stage. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapaha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation providing for holding of elections for the above two local authorities under the mixed system of elections based on the ward system re-calling nominations and calling for fresh nominations, was approved by the Cabinet.",
