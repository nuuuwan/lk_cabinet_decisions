  "decision_details": "- The non\u2011availability of adequate residential facilities for Officers of the Special Task Force of the Sri Lanka Police deployed for special security services in Colombo and the surrounding areas, has caused a problem.  As a remedial measure for the issue, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayake, the Minister of Law & Order and Southern Development, to remove a dilapidated barrack situated in the Gonahena Camp Premises and construct a three storeyed building in its place which could facilitate the accommodation of 250 Officers at an estimated cost of Rs.75.9 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
