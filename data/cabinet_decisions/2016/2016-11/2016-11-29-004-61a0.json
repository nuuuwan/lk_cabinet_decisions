  "decision_details": "- The touts at the Arrival Lobby and the Porch Area considered as public areas at the Bandaranaike International Airport are engaged in providing unauthorized transport facilities, money changing and baggage loading and illegal activities and this has caused much difficulties to the  passengers as well as the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd.  As the existing legislation is inadequate to control the situation, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to amend the Civil Aviation Act, No.14 of 2010 to prevent touting at the premises of the Airport by various persons, was approved by the Cabinet.",
