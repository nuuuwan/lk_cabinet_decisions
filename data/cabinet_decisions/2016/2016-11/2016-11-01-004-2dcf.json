  "decision_details": "- Despite several laws being implemented and awareness programmes, conducted the producers, traders and consumers dispose of various non-degradable packages, electric and electronic wastes to the environment in an irresponsible manner.  Presently, 60% (210,000 MT) of the annual total plastic and polythene inflow to the country gets added to the natural environment.  As a solution to the problem, it has been proposed to implement the concept of Polluter Pays Principle where the polluter of the environment should pay the compensation.  According to this concept, a deposit is to be obtained temporarily from the consumer at the time of purchasing the goods, which will be refunded to the consumer when the remaining non-degradable wastes is returned to the trader after the consumption of such goods. In respect of deposits made for electronic and electrical equipment used for longer periods, it is proposed to pay an annual interest, calculated on the duration, to the consumer. Through this process, having collected the waste at designated places,  it will be convenient for waste management in an eco-friendly manner.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to establish an Officials' Committee comprising of the representatives of the relevant institutions to make recommendations to implement the above procedure, ensuring the responsibility of the producer, trader and the consumer and to initiate a pilot project on the recommendations of the said Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
