  "decision_details": "- Bids were invited for repairing 1,000 old buses of the Sri Lanka Transport Board but since the repairing cost of a bus, in accordance with the responses received was almost equal to the cost of procuring a new bus, it was found that repairing is not economically productive.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to suspend the project for the repairing of 1,000 buses and instead to purchase 40-46 seater (2x2) high back, 1,000 new passenger buses, was approved by the Cabinet.",
