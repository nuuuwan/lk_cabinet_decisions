  "decision_details": "- In terms of the provisions of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, to which Sri Lanka is also a party, each Member State is required to establish an independent organization for the conduct of investigations into aircraft accidents and incidents that fall within the jurisdiction of the State. The objective of this requirement is to identify the causal factors that led to an accident or incident and make recommendations for  improvements of the aviation system with the aim of preventing future accidents and incidents.  In terms of the Civil Aviation Act, No.14 of 2010, the responsibility of conducting investigations into aircraft accidents and incidents, is vested with the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri  Lanka.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to draft necessary legislation for the establishment of 'Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau of Sri Lanka', as an independent organization for the conduct of investigations into aircraft accidents and incidents, in terms of the obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
