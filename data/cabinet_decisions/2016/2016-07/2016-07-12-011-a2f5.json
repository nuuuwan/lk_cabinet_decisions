  "decision_details": "- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided a grant of Rs.100 million for the scholarship programme implemented for the students of low income families who follow the newly introduced Technology Stream of the G.C.E. (Advanced Level) and the said programme is implemented through the Department of Public Trustee.  However, since a considerable amount of the grant has to be spent on administrative matters, a situation has arisen where the anticipated objectives of the scholarship programme are not achieved. Therefore,  in order to make use of the relevant funds for the anticipated objectives, enabling a greater number of students to have the benefits, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to get the funds transferred to the Ministry of Education, which are currently credited to the Department of Public Trustee and thereafter to continuously implement this scholarship programme through an annual allocation from the Budget, under a relevant Expenditure Head of the General Treasury,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
