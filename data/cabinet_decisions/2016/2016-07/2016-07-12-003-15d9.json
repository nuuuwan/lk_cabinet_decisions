  "decision_details": "- \tDue to usage of vehicles under the name of the first owner without the registration of the transfer where the ownership has changed for over a long period and circulation of vehicles among various persons on open transfer papers, the Government is deprived of a large amount of income including registration charges and this situation has caused many difficulties for the law enforcement institutions as well.  Although a method of delayed charges was introduced through the Motor Traffic (Fees) Regulations published in the year 2011, in a bid to minimize this trend, it is observed that the anticipated objectives have not been achieved.  As such,  the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to provide a concessionary period of three months for the vehicle owners who have not applied for registration of transfers within the specified time period, although the ownership has been changed, to register such transfers and in order to persuade such registration of transfers, to grant a concession on the additional fee levied in such instances, was approved by the Cabinet.",
