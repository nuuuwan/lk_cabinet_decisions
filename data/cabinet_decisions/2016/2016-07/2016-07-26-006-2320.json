  "decision_details": "- The National Institute of Social Development functioning under the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare, is the only state educational institution in Sri Lanka that provides education on social work.  This Institute conducts study courses that possess a high level  of quality which include practical sessions as well.  Presently, approximately 1,500 students who follow the 17 full time courses conducted by this institution, engage in their studies amidst various difficulties, within a space of 70,000 sq.ft. obtained on lease basis and it has been identified that the space available is inadequate for the functions such as conduct of study courses, office work and also for the provision of welfare facilities  to the academic staff and the students. Therefore, as per the recommendation made by the Officials' Committee appointed to investigate into the matter, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare, to construct a building of about 100,000 sq.ft. as the first phase of the project on constructing a building complex for the National Institute of Social Development, was approved by the Cabinet.",
