  "decision_details": "- With the end of the conflict situation, the economic activities in the area of Kaduruwela increased tremendously, and it has resulted in issues such as traffic congestion and parking issues; and due to the haphazard development, a number of environmental and social issues have emerged as well. The Urban Development Authority (UDA), having considered the said issues, has designed the Kaduruwela Town Expansion Project and a number of projects are to be implemented under the said programme. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to award the designing activities of phase 1 of the project, land development activities, construction of drainage system and land filling, to Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
