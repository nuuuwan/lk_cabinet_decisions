  "decision_details": "- The Provincial General Hospital, Ratnapura is the largest tertiary health care hospital in the Sabaragamuwa Province and it provides health services to a large number of patients from the adjacent Provinces.  However, presently, there is only one ward with 68 beds for paediatric patients. Due to direct admission of patients as well as the patients transferred to the hospital from other hospitals, the Paediatric Ward is constantly overcrowded. Considering the necessity of increasing the quality of patient care services and also the increase in the number of children admitted to the hospital, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to construct a two storied building for the Paediatric Ward of the Provincial General Hospital, Ratnapura, utilizing the donations made by the donors, enabling the addition of 116 additional beds to the said ward, at an estimated cost of Rs.70 million and for the Government to provide the other facilities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
