  "decision_details": "- The Divisional Secretariat, Kalutara which is situated centering the Kalutara Town, is comprised of 87 Grama Niladhari Divisions, with a total population of about 159,225. Presently, the Divisional Secretariat, Kalutara is established in the second floor of the District Secretariat and it causes various difficulties for the officers serving there as well as the public who come for services, due to the minimal space available. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Vajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Home Affairs, to construct a separate building for the Divisional Secretariat, Kalutara at a total estimated cost of Rs.180 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
