  "decision_details": "- The Engineering professionals who qualify from different educational establishments in Sri Lanka and abroad, possess different levels of academic and professional competencies depending on the standard and level of the educational programmes they followed, practice Engineering at different levels. However, an accepted formal methodology for registering or granting licenses followed in respect of the professionals in the fields of Medicine and Law, who qualify similarly from different establishments, is  not pursued in respect of the Engineering professionals.  Accordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power & Renewable Energy and Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to publish 'the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka Bill' drafted for the purposes of establishing the 'Engineering Council, Sri Lanka', which shall be responsible for the maintenance of professional standard and conduct of engineering practitioners, registration of different categories of engineering practitioners and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto, in the Government Gazette and thereafter to submit same in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
