  "decision_details": "- The Perahera culture in Sri Lanka has inherited a proud history and especially the splendid peraheras such as  Dalada Perahera  have  drawn the attention of the whole world. It has been observed that, participation of Tuskers and Elephants is essential to maintain the beauty, magnificence and sacredness of a procession. The obtaining of elephants for peraheras has become a problem when Dalada Perahera and other famous peraheras are held during the same period of time. It has been found difficult to have all the existing elephants participate in pageant occasions due to the ageing and musth of elephants.  Accordingly, with the objective of training elephants to take part in pageant activities, the proposal made by Hon. Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, to establish a pool of  tamed Elephants from Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and Udawalawa 'Eth Athuru Sewana' if necessary, to a maximum of  35 Tuskers / Male Elephants/Female Elephants and maintain it as a unit of the Department of Zoology, was approved by the Cabinet.",
