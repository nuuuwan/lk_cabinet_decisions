  "decision_details": "- Although, plans have been drawn up to initiate a number of long term and medium term measures to minimize the elephant-human conflict, it would take a considerable period of time to implement such plans and obtain results.  As such, an arrangement is required to minimize the harm that may occur from wild elephants during this period. Similarly, an arrangement is also required to avoid the attacks on humans by creatures such as leopards and crocodiles, as well as to minimize the harm that may be caused to such creatures by humans.  As a short term measure for the above purpose, the proposal made by Hon. Gamini Jayawickrema Perera, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, to establish 'Wildlife Control Units' covering wildlife zones where the conflicts between wildlife and humans are mostly reported,  to visit such places immediately and take necessary action expeditiously, if any such incident is reported, has already been approved by the Cabinet.  The proposal made by Hon. Mrs. Sumedha G. Jayasena, the Acting Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, to establish 05 Wildlife Control Units expeditiously, as a pilot project and to proceed with the establishment of the remaining Units, after reviewing the progress of the established Units by 06 months, as per the recommendations made by the Officials' Committee appointed to study the matter and submit recommendations in this regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
