  "decision_details": "- Even though the Western Province accounts for only 5.7% of the total land extent of the country, it contributes more than 50% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is an immensely important industrial, commercial and administrative centre in Sri Lanka. Five (05) major river basins of Sri Lanka, including Kalu and Kelani Rivers are located in the Western Province and hence, it will be vitally important to improve the existing infrastructure facilities to minimize the risk of frequent floods, in transforming the Western Region into a Megapolis on par with the international standards. As per now, around 30% of the activities of the Weras Ganga Stormwater Drainage and Environment Improvement Project have been completed. Accordingly, with a view to exploring long term solutions for the flood issues in the flood prone areas of the Western Province, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to implement 08 projects expeditiously, including the construction of two (02) small tunnels to enhance the capacity of disposal of stormwater to the sea and the construction of two (02) pumping stations to pump  stormwater to the sea,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
