  "decision_details": "- The basic objective of the 'Shelter for All' National Housing Programme proposed to be implemented in the year 2016, is to construct new houses, upgrade the existing houses and to grant ownership of the houses and lands to the residents. This programme is expected to be implemented, so as to cover the entire country and all the sectors. Accordingly, 1,000 houses with a floor area of 500 square feet per house are scheduled to be constructed in each electorate, and the maximum contribution by the Government for a house will be Rs.300,000/-. A sum of Rs.5,800 million has already been allocated to the Ministry of Housing and Construction through the Budget Estimates - 2016, for the implementation of this housing programme and therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to obtain the balance provision further required for the implementation of this  programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
