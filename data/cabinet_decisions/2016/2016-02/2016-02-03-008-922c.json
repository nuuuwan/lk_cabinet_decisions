  "decision_details": "- There is a high demand for Sri Lankan Seafarers, from the  International Shipping Companies, because of their knowledge, skills and positive attitudes.  Sri Lankan Naval Captains, Officers, Marine Engineers and other Technical officers are presently employed in mega ships of  several companies and Sri Lanka derives a considerable amount of foreign exchange on their earnings. It is a legal requirement for the Sri Lankan Seafarers to obtain the 'Continuous Discharge Certificate(CDC)' and 'Certificate of Competency(COC)' issued by the Director General of Merchant Shipping, to engage in their occupations.  In comparison with the certificates issued to their Seafarers by the developed countries, the quality of the certificates issued to the Sri Lankan Seafarers should be further upgraded to be complied with the International Standards. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to implement a project to issue a 'Continuous Discharge Certificate' and a 'Certificate of Competency' which possess recognition at international level, incorporating bio metric information, to the Sri Lankan Seafarers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
