  "decision_details": "- As per the present global trends, computer literacy is an essential factor for the progress of a country and accordingly, Sri Lanka has also introduced various programmes, paying more attention to computer literacy. Further, computer literacy will become a compulsory qualification in entering into the Job Market. The UNIS, which is affiliated to the Tsinghua University of China has submitted a proposal for the implementation of an e-Education project in Sri Lanka, and  it is proposed to provide benefits through this project to those who couldn't enter the universities, the unemployed youth and the employed youth  devoid of computer literacy. Under this programme, e-Education Centres will be established in all nine (09) provinces including the main centre to be established in Colombo. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Science, Technology and Research, to implement this project in collaboration with the relevant Ministries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
