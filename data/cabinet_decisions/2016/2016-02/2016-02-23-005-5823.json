  "decision_details": "- The objective of the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI) is to foster the development of agricultural research in the Asia-Pacific Region. The Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy holds the membership of this association since the year 1988 and according to the membership categorization of that Association, Sri Lanka belongs to the category 'C'. Since this Association offers many of its training programmes and expert consultations without any additional expenses, other than the annual subscription fee, in order to receive more benefits, the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to upgrade the membership of the Sri Lanka Council for Agricultural Research Policy in the said Association, from category 'C' to category 'B', was approved by the Cabinet.",
