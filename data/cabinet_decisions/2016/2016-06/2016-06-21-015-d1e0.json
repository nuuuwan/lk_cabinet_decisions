  "decision_details": "- The price fluctuation of fruits and vegetables, at different times of the year, including B onions\tand Potatoes, has caused adverse effects to the farmer as well as to the consumer.  Since the cultivation of crops in Sri Lanka\t occurs in terms of seasonal patterns, funds have been allocated through the 2016 Budget proposals for the provision of cold stores facilities, to ensure the continuous supply of harvest throughout the year.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to construct cold stores, as a pilot project, closer to the Dambulla Special Economic Centre for some selected vegetables and fruits, including B Onions and closer to the Keppetipola Special Economic Centre for some selected vegetables and fruits, including Potatoes, was approved by the Cabinet.",
