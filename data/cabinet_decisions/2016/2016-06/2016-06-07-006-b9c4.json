  "decision_details": "- For the first time, provision of gift vouchers instead of clothing material for school uniforms was implemented at the end of the school term in December in the year 2015. Parents were able to provide their children with school uniform material with the stipulated standard and quality as the Government anticipated and thus save the cost and time incurred by the Government previously, on storing, packing, transporting and quality controlling of the school uniform material. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to add a reasonable additional amount to the vouchers, in consideration of the increase of the market prices of clothes, based on the past year experiences and to pass the benefit over to the students in the Government schools and Government assisted schools and the student Bhikkus and lay students in the Government approved pirivenas and to continue to implement the programme in the same manner, was approved by the Cabinet.",
