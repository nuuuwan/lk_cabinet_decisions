  "decision_details": "- The implementation of the proposed Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project, would directly benefit the people in the districts of Anuradhapura, Vavuniya and Mannar and it would pave the way for the successful cultivation of 12,425 hectares of arable land in the Yodha Weva and Akathimuruppu Irrigation Scheme of Mannar in both Yala and Maha Seasons where no proper irrigation facilities are available. The Environmental Assessment Report and the Archaeological Evaluation Report of the project  are presently being reviewed and the plans are afoot for resettling of 160 low-income families living in the project area. Since the project has been identified as a very productive investment according to the feasibility study report of the project and as such, the joint proposal made by Hon. Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, the Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management and Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to implement the Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project expeditiously, in order to increase the food production of Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet, as a matter of principle.",
