  "decision_details": "- Domestic airports are located in all the other provinces of Sri Lanka, except in the Uva and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. It takes more than\t06 hours at least, to travel from Colombo to Badulla by a vehicle and\tthat time can be restricted to 25 minutes by way of flights and the establishment of an airport in the Badulla district will serve immensely for the promotion of tourism in the area and the development of  cultivation of economic crops for export purposes. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to establish a domestic\tairport at Bandarawela in the Badulla district, was approved in principle by the\tCabinet.",
