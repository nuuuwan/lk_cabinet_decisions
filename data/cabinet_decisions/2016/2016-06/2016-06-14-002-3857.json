  "decision_details": "- The ageing population of Sri Lanka constitutes 12.4% of the total population at present. The ageing population of Sri Lanka is rapidly increasing and it is anticipated that it would exceed 24.8% by the year 2041. When considering the increase of elderly population day by day, it is necessary to provide them with the opportunity of spending their lives with self-respect and dignity. The 'Seth Sevana' Elders Home at Mirigama, in which 265 elders presently reside, was established to commemorate Right Honourable D.S. Senanayake, and it is the largest elders home located in the Western Province and maintained by the Government. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare, to obtain financial provision for preliminary repairs including the water supply of the Elders Home, was approved by the Cabinet.",
