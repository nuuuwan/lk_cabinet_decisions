  "decision_details": "- The Dedicated Economic Centre at Veyangoda established in the year 2007 consists of 70 business units and 06 stores and it is a highly important business centre for the trade and consumer community of the area.  Since the present approach road for the Dedicated Economic Centre is situated at a considerable distance from the Veyangoda Town, the consumers are reluctant to visit the Centre and also as there is no approach road to the Centre from the Nittambuwa - Katunayake Main Road, which runs close to the Centre, the lorry owners who use the said road for the transportation of vegetables and other items from various places such as Dambulla, Welimada, Nuwara-Eliya are also reluctant to come to the Centre. This state of affairs has adversely affected the development of the Centre and therefore, to avoid this situation, the joint proposal made by Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, the Minister of Industry and Commerce and Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to allocate the 40 perches of land belonging to the Food Commissioner's Department situated in the area, to construct a convenient approach way  providing direct access to the Economic Centre, from the Katunayake - Nittambuwa Main Road, was approved by the Cabinet.",
