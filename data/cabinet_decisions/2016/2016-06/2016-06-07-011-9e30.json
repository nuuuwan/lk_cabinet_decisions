  "decision_details": "- A necessity has arisen to provide for the Registration of Persons who are missing and their whereabouts unknown, especially those who are reported missing in the course of, consequent to, or in connection with the conflict in the Northern and Eastern provinces and/or its aftermath or in connection with the political unrest, and/or civil disturbances, and due to enforced disappearances. Such registration and issuance of 'Certificates of Absence' to the relatives of such missing persons will enable their relatives  to manage the properties and assets of the missing person, temporarily obtain provisional guardianship of children of the missing person, make applications for the benefits under the social welfare schemes and make representations before the relevant authorities and make requests on behalf of the missing person. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Vajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Home Affairs, to  amend the Registration of Deaths (Temporary Provisions) Act, No.19 of 2010, with a view to issuing the 'Certificates of Absence' regarding missing persons or for the cancellation of the Certificate of Absence in the event of the missing person being found to be alive or deceased or the  issuance of a certificate of death with regard to the person concerned, was approved by the Cabinet.",
