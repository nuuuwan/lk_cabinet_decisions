  "decision_details": "- People living in islands suburban to Jaffna peninsula including Delft and Nagadeepa use boat transport services for their day to day necessities. In addition to that, the tourists who visit religious places also use boats as their mode of transportation.  However, due to problems such as lack of sufficient and secure boat services, available facilities in the jetties being at a minimum level and the existing light house being in a condition which deserves renovation, have caused obstacles/impediments to the coastal passenger transportation. As a solution to this situation,  the proposal made by Hon. Arjuna Ranathunga, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to develop and regulate the coastal passenger transportation activities through the Director General of Merchant Shipping and to introduce appropriate  amendments to the Boat Ordinance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
