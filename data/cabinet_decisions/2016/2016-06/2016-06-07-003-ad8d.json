  "decision_details": "- Use of the fertile lands and water resources productively in the Monaragala district, which still is a backward district, for the benefit of the people, would cause to eliminate the poverty in the area. A reservoir with a capacity of 48 million Cubic Meters will be built across Kumbukkan Oya reservoir through the above project and it is expected to provide irrigation for 4,280 hectares of new lands in Buttala, Monaragala and Siyambalanduwa areas and for 1,255 hectares of agricultural lands already cultivated.  It would also pave the way for providing drinking water to Monaragala, Nakkala, Kumbukkana, Okkampitiya and Buttala areas and generate electricity, as well. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, the Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, to implement the Kumbukkan Oya Reservoir Project by obtaining funds locally as well as from foreign countries, was approved by the Cabinet, as a matter of Principle.",
