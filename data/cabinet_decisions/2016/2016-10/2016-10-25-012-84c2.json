  "decision_details": "- The Global Leaders, through the Paris Agreement entered into in the year 2015, have agreed to keep the global temperature increase restricted at   20 C during the next century.  When compared with the major countries which emit green house gasses like China (20.08%), the United States of America (17.89%) and Russia/India/Japan/Canada (combined 17.34%), the Green House Gas Emissions by Sri Lanka, amounts to about 0.05%.  However, Sri Lanka is committed to reducing the amount of Green House Gas released in 2010 up to 20% by the year 2030. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to implement a project for formulation of a framework for monitoring and reporting the contribution made by Sri Lanka with the Private Sector, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), for the reduction of the Green House Gas Emission, was approved by the Cabinet.",
