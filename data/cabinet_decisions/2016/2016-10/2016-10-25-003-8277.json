  "decision_details": "- Capital market strategy plays a major role in facilitating the rapid expansion and the sustained growth of emerging economies around the world.  However, the potential of Sri Lanka's capital market remains unrealised.  Hence, it is essential to develop a strong, efficient and vibrant capital market in Sri Lanka by creating an environment conducive to instilling trust and confidence among share issuers, investors, market institutions and market intermediaries. As such, with a view to laying the ground work for the purpose, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to adopt the regulatory and development measures proposed in the 'Capital Market Strategy 2016-2020', was approved by the Cabinet.",
