  "decision_details": "- The Oluvil Fishery Harbour is the largest fishery harbour constructed for the fisheries industry in the Eastern Province, with a harbour base of 3.5 meters in depth, berthing facilities for large number of multi-day trawlers and other harbour infrastructure facilities. There is a high potential to develop the export fishery industry and the fish processing industry centering this fishery harbour which also possesses the required  basic facilities to initiate fish processing factories.  With a view to extensively developing the fisheries industry in the Eastern Province and making this harbour a profitable commercial venture, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, to vest the Oluvil Fisheries harbour presently administered by  the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), with the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) functioning under the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, was approved by the Cabinet.",
