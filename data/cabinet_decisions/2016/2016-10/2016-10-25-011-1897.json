  "decision_details": "- The policy of the Government is to locate all public institutions found in the Colombo city, at Battaramulla in the Administrative Capital of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte. Therefore, most of the public institutions have already been located at Battaramulla.  To coincide with this development, it is essential to provide the infrastructure facilities like road network and transport systems to the neighbouring areas expeditiously.  Accordingly, it is proposed to lay a by-pass road, 4km in length, from Polduwa Junction up to Koswatta Junction with a view to providing easy access to the public institutions. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to extend the by-pass road section from Polduwa Junction up to \u2018Suhurupaya\u2019, which has been designed as Stage-I of the project, with the objective of easing the huge traffic congestion now found in the Battaramulla junction and to complete the project, at an estimated cost of Rs.250 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
