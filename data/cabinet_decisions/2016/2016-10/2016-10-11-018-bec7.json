  "decision_details": "- The number of students presently receiving education within the State University system is about 94,000 and the development of buildings and other facilities required to provide  adequate hostel facilities to 52,800 out of this number, have been completed.  Since the Government has planned to increase the annual intake of students to State Universities by 10%, action has to be taken to provide more hostel facilities.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, to construct 24 new hostels to provide hostel facilities for a further number of about 9,600 university students, at a cost of Rs.1,430 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
