  "decision_details": "- Due to irregular development and unauthorized constructions, the area of Colombo Fort and Pettah has become a highly congested area. It has been planned to utilize the blocks of land which had not undergone development due to such irregular constructions and thereby left idling in the middle of the city without being put to any public use, for authorized development works. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to construct two pedestrian paths in the area along the Lake House premises and Beira Lake from D.R. Wijewardene Mawatha to Olcott Mawatha and along the pathway that runs from Olcott Mawatha to Sea Street, at an estimated cost of Rs.44 million and to relocate the shops removed with the objective of regularizing the pavement at Olcott Mawatha, at an estimated cost of Rs.22 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
