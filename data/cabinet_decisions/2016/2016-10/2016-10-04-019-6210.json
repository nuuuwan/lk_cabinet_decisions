  "decision_details": "- When implementing development proposals, the existence of a proper coordination between the Line Ministries and the Provincial Councils will prevent the duplication of tasks and enable the utilization of resources at its optimum level. Therefore, in order to maintain a proper coordination between the Line Ministries and the Provincial Councils, instead of each Ministry conducting its affairs separately with each Provincial Council, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, to hold a Conference of the Provincial Chief Secretaries and Secretaries of Line Ministries, in Colombo, once in every two months and to coordinate and implement the said Conference through the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
