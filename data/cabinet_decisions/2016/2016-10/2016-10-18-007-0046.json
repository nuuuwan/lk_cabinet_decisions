  "decision_details": "- A sign or an indication which gives an item a unique identity, owing to the specific qualities and characteristics that could be attributed to the country or region in which it has originated, is known as a 'Geographical Indication' (GI) and such an item is an asset to the country of its origin. 'Ceylon Tea' and 'Ceylon Cinnamon', products which render an immense contribution to the economy of Sri Lanka,  have been identified as GIs  through the Intellectual Property Act, No.36 of 2003, as goods that originate in Sri Lanka. However, since a legal framework relating to the registration  of GIs in Sri Lanka is not in operation, the producers and exporters are faced with problems. Therefore, as per the recommendation of the Officials' Committee which had examined this matter,  the proposal made by Hon. Rishad Bathiudeen, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, to publish the  Bill  prepared to amend the Intellectual Property Act, No.36 of 2003,  vesting the authority with the Minister in charge of the subject to issue orders to safeguard, register and certify any product that originated in Sri Lanka, in the Government Gazette and thereafter to present the same in the Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
