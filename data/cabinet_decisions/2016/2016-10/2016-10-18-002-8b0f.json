  "decision_details": "- The preparation and implementation of plans for coast conservation engineering work within the coastal area of about 250 sq.km., in the Gampaha, Puttalam and Mannar Districts and regulation and control of development activities in the coastal areas are being carried out through the Regional Engineering Office of the Department of Coast Conservation built in Negombo area in the year 1987.  The building, in which this office is presently housed, is about 30 years old and the facilities found there are inadequate for the present day requirements. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to construct a new three storied building for the Negombo Regional Engineering Office of the Department of Coast Conservation, at an estimated cost of Rs.60 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
