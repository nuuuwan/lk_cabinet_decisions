  "decision_details": "- A large number of young graduates, who pass out annually from the Universities in Sri Lanka, remaining in an unemployed or under-employed condition for a considerable period of time, has become a social, economic as well as a political issue.  Nevertheless, it is also observed that vacancies exist in posts, in certain fields of the private sector, for which the Degree is considered as a basic qualification. Therefore, with the hope of  referring unemployed graduates to the plantation sector, which is one area where such vacancies exist, the proposal made by Hon. Navin Dissanayake, the Minister of Plantation Industries, to commence a Residential Training Course under the National Institute of Plantation Management (NIPM), as a pilot project, to train unemployed graduates for the managerial posts that are vacant in the Regional Plantation Companies, was approved by the Cabinet.",
