  "decision_details": "- The reduction in the speed of data transmission under the Lanka Government Network (LGN), introduced by the Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) during the period of 2007-2012, for the purpose of maintaining interconnections through digital means between government institutions and the public and among government institutions themselves, has become a major obstacle to attaining the goal of digitizing the economy as envisaged by the Government. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Harin Fernando, the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, to implement project 2 of the LGN aimed at providing secure, high speed internet connections and free Wi-Fi services required for e-Government activities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
