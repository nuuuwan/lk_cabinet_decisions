  "decision_details": "- The Beira lake, extending over an area of approximately 120 ha. in the middle of Colombo city, adds considerable beauty to the city while supporting the drainage of rain water, recreational activities and biodiversity. Due to wastewater discharged through various activities in surrounding environs of the Beira Lake, sewers illegally directed into it and the solid waste, this water source is being subjected to pollution. Similarly, due to the irregular development activities carried out in the adjacent lands, access to the lake bund is also obstructed from many places. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to implement the Beira Lake Redevelopment Project, in order to develop the Beira lake and the surrounding area as a place with pleasant environmental conditions and recreational facilities in the city of Colombo, at an estimated cost of Rs.12,550 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
