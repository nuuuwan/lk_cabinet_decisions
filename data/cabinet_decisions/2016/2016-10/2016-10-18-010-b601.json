  "decision_details": "- The 'Acland House' ('Visumpaya') Building, which is a two storeied building, built as an Officers' Mess of the Ceylon Rifle Regiment during the colonial era, is gradually getting dilapidated and carrying out rehabilitation and renovation  activities in a manner that would preserve its historical value, has become necessary. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to develop and manage the said building as a 'Boutique Hotel' with a unique identity which provides high quality services including accommodation facilities, aimed at high-end tourists and  special guests, was approved by the Cabinet.",
