  "decision_details": "- There are 31 crop and livestock farms across the island belonging to the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) that contribute to the provision of necessary patronage to small scale farmers, national dairy production, meat production and the egg production process. Although the 04 large scale diary farms of the NLDB situated in Central and Southern Provinces have been developed, investing a large sum of money, it has been found difficult to obtain necessary funds to develop other farms with similar potential. Therefore, the focus of the Government has been drawn towards the development of such farms in collaboration with the private sector.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Rural Economy, to amend to the State Agricultural Corporation Act, No.11 of 1972, incorporating the legal provisions required for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
