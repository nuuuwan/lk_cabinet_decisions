  "decision_details": "- As per a proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, an Officials' Committee has already been appointed to study and submit recommendations on finding long term solutions for the prevention of severe coastal erosion that takes place in an area of around 550 meters of coastal stretch situated north of Oluvil Port in the Ampara District and providing relief to the people affected by  the said erosion. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority has already initiated the conservation activities of an area of 150 meters along this coastal stretch and the balance portion of about 400 meters has to be conserved very early.  Since long term conservation methodologies will take time, the proposal made by Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to carry out expeditious steps of raising obstructing sand mounds along the coastal stretch and the erecting stone ridges as remedial measures, with the assistance of the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management Department, was approved by the Cabinet.",
