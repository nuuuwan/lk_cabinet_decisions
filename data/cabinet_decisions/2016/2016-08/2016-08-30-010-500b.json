  "decision_details": "- The Police of Sri Lanka has been denominated under various terms during different eras. Under the Police Ordinance, No.16 of 1865 and the Departmental Orders it has been known as 'Sri Lanka Police Force', after 1945 it has been termed as the 'Sri Lanka Police Department' and since the year 1972 it has been known as the 'Sri Lanka Police Service'. The Sri Lanka Police Department commemorates its 150th anniversary this year and in this context, considering the need to use a standard term to address that department, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka, the Minister of Law & Order and Southern Development, to use the name 'Sri Lanka Police' hereinafter for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
