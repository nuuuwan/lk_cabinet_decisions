  "decision_details": "- The Government of Sri Lanka has taken action for the gradual removal of the ozone depleting substances from use and for the introduction of ozone friendly alternative substances and technologies, in terms of the provisions of Vienna Convention and Montreal Protocol on protection of the ozone layer.  Accordingly, methodologies to limit the import of  Hydrochloroflurocarbons (HCFCs) chemicals, which have a direct impact on global warming and an import quota system were introduced in the year 2013.  As a result, availability of these chemical substances in the market has been limited and this could have an adverse impact on the services and maintenance work carried out utilizing these substances, especially on the refrigeration and air conditioning sector. Therefore, the proposal made by H. E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to appoint a Committee comprising of the representatives of the relevant Ministries, Departments and agencies, to review the proposals, presented as short term and long term solutions to bring the situation under control and submit  recommendations to the Cabinet, was approved by the Cabinet.",
