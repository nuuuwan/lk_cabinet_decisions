  "decision_details": "- The Training School at Katukurunda functions as the main training school of the Special Task Force functioning under the Sri Lanka Police Department.  A number of trainings such as training on VIP security, training on Riots Control, training on Search and Bomb Disposal are being carried out in this Training School.  In addition, training is also provided for both local and foreign groups of security personnel.  The building which is presently used to provide hostel facilities for the officers who are engaged in training at this Training School is very old and can provide accommodation facilities for only 100 officers.  As such, in order to enable the school to provide hostel facilities to 200 trainee officers at a time, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayake, the Minister of Law & Order and Southern Development, to construct a new two storied building with modern facilities, for the Katukurunda Training School of the Special Task Force, at an estimated cost of Rs.101.49 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
