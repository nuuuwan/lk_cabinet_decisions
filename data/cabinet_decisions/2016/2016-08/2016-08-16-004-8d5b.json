  "decision_details": "- In terms of the provisions of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No. 20 of 2009, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is required to take action to protect the public from dangers that may arise from the generation, transmission, distribution, supply or use of electricity. The deaths reported in Sri Lanka in the year 2012, due to accidental electrocution were 180 and it is a very high figure when compared with the international indexes. The Commission has implemented various awareness campaigns and a number of direct interventions to minimize the number of deaths occurred due to electrocution, as much as possible, by the year 2020. Accordingly, the number of deaths by accidental electrocution was reduced down to 77 in the year 2015.  The use of numerous types of plugs and sockets, sub\u2011standard electrical equipment,   adapters and extension cords has been identified as the major cause for the electrocutions and fires. Therefore, taking into consideration the views expressed by the general public, professionals and other relevant institutions, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies  and Economic Affairs, to adopt the internationally recognized type G as the unique and single standard for the plugs and socket outlets in Sri Lanka hereafter and to allow all existing wiring, as well as plugs and sockets presently in use or sold within the next two years, which do not comply with said standards to remain in service, until the end of their useful life, was approved by the Cabinet.",
