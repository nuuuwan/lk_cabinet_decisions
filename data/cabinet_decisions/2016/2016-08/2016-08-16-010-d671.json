Especially, the service provided through the Anamadurwa town as a sales centre for the agricultural products produced in the surrounding areas and as a service centre for   supplying of input goods to a large catchment area is remarkable. The Anamaduwa Bus Stand is located in the centre of the town and provides transport facilities to around 15,000 passengers daily.  The Anamaduwa Bus Stand Development Project is identified as a priority project under the Anamaduwa Draft Development Plan and its construction works have been commenced in the year 2012 with Provincial Council funding and a part of construction has been completed. Since this project is implemented mainly for the upliftment of the quality of urban facilities, in order to benefit the public, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to complete the balance works of the project by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and to get a provision of  Rs.25 million allocated for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
