  "decision_details": "- Motor Cycles which are not registered in the Department of Motor Traffic can be commonly found in the country. These motor cycles which are frequently used in areas where public transport facilities are low, render a sufficient contribution to the agricultural economy of the rural areas while many of such motor cycles are also used by self-employed persons. Although, such motor cycles make a sufficient contribution to the rural economy, the Government annually loses a considerable income due to non-registration and it has been identified that it would be appropriate to grant an opportunity to register these motor cycles by imposing a surcharge, in order to suppress frauds, corruption and thefts and establish the rule of law in the country.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to allow registration as a concession after inspection of motor cycles without legal documents, to implement it in a manner without causing prejudice to legitimate motor cycle importers and in conformity with the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act and to grant this relief only for a period of four (04) months, was approved by the Cabinet.",
