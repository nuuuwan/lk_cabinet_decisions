  "decision_details": "- As recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management, the Government has taken action to grant a financial subsidy for fertilizer, proportionate to the annually cultivated land, to Smallholders who own a cultivated land in extent of 01 hectare or less in the tea, coconut and rubber sectors. Accordingly, there will be an entitlement to a financial subsidy of Rs.15,000/-, per hectare for tea; Rs.9,000/- per hectare for coconut and Rs.5,000/- per hectare for rubber.
