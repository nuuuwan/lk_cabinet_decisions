  "decision_details": "- Presently about 50% of the electricity in Sri Lanka is generated through   renewable energy  sources and the Government anticipates to increase that production up to 60% by the year 2020 and up to 70% by the year 2030.  Accordingly, it will be necessary to construct Wind Power Plants of about 600 MW and Solar Energy Plants of about 3,000 MW within the next 10 years.  In this process, it has been planned to implement a small solar power plant promotion programme known as 'Soorya Bala Sangramaya' (the Battle for Solar Energy generation), with the participation of electricity consumers and electricity producers,  especially through construction of small solar panels on the roof tops of houses.  Under this programme, it is expected to convert at least 20% of electricity consumers to be electricity producers and make payments for the excess electricity so generated.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to implement this project as a national programme, within the next 10 years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
