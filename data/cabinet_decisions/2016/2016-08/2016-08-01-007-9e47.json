  "decision_details": "- Two separate water supply schemes each for the Matara and Weligama Municipal / Urban Council areas and Pradeshiya Sabha areas in Matara district are being implemented and the capacity of the said two water supply schemes is insufficient to meet the daily increasing consumer demand. With a view to providing a solution to this situation, it has been decided to implement the 'Matara Stage IV Water Supply Project' and the said project will be completed in the year 2019. Until then, with a view to introducing short term expeditious solutions to the issues existing in the Matara and Weligama Water Supply Schemes in the Matara district,  the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning  & Water Supply, to implement the tasks related to the improvement of the production capacity of the Malimbada and Halalla Water Treatment Plants (WTPs), at an estimated cost of Rs.477 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
