  "decision_details": "- Priority has been accorded for the construction of buildings for Police Stations and the improvement of the existing Police Stations under the special programme initiated in order to maintain law and order within the Northern Province. Although, Cabinet approval was granted in 2014, to construct a new building for the Mulativu Police Station instead of the building it occupied on rental basis, the implementation of the project has been delayed.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayaka, the Minister of Law & Order and Southern Development, to initiate the construction of the building for the Mulativu Police Station expeditiously, was approved by the Cabinet.",
