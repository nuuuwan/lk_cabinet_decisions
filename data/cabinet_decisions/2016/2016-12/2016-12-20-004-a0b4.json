  "decision_details": "- At present, an unprecedented attention is being diverted worldwide in the generation of electricity through the eco-friendly renewable energy sources. In this respect, a high priority has been accorded to solar power.  Presently, solar power plants of 11.3Mw have been connected to the Central Electricity Board Network of Sri Lanka and up to now nearly 30Mw is generated under the Net Metering System. By now, several projects are being implemented with the objective of increasing electricity generation in Sri Lanka through solar power and it has also been planned to establish 03 new solar power parks. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.
