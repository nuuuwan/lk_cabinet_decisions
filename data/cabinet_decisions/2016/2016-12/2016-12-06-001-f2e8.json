  "decision_details": "- Due to the state of the national security that prevailed in the Island it was essential to deploy the Army personnel to the duties in respect of law and order, by removing such personnel from the duties assigned at public and private institutions, economical nerve centres and other special institutions. Accordingly, the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited was established as a security service affiliated to the Government for providing protection for the said institutions. However, due to the peaceful environment prevalent at present, it is observed that a state owned private security service is no longer required.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, to transfer the Ground Defence activities to the Civil Security Service Department and the Marine Security activities to the Sri Lanka Navy, was approved by the Cabinet in principle.",
