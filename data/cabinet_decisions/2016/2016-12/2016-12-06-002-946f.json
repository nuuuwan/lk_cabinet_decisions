  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka holds a premier position among the countries where bio-diversity is rampant.  Hence, it has become essential to protect the natural environment network of the country and also to conserve the plants and animal species inherent to the country.  Studies on invasive alien organisms have revealed that the existing laws are inadequate to control the threats caused to the bio-diversity of Sri Lanka, from invading plants and animal species. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to instruct the Legal Draftsman, to draft a new Act, making provisions to prevent the infiltration of dangerous and invading plants and animal species to Sri Lanka and to destroy such plants and animals, was approved by the Cabinet.",
