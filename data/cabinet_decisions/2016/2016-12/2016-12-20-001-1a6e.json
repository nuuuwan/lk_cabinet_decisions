  "decision_details": "- The Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology, a major non-contagious disease, which has taken root in Sri Lanka recently has by now become more prevalent in the North Central, Uva, Wayamba, Northern, Central and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, while patients have also been reported, to a certain extent, in the District of Hambantota in the Southern Province. This disease has not only become a major health hazard but also has created several socio economic problems, as well. In order to overcome the health crisis which has arisen due to the disease, it is essential to launch a programme for prevention, screening of patients, treatment of patients, implementation of welfare measures constantly for the families of the patients and the provision of safe drinking water.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to obtain funds necessary for the National Programme on   Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease implemented by the Presidential Task Force on  Prevention of Kidney Disease during the period from 2016 to 2018, was approved by the Cabinet.",
