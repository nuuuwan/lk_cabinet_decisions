  "decision_details": "- Under the redevelopment programme of the Colombo City, it has been planned to relocate the Manning Market at Pettah in Peliyagoda and to construct the main building of the Multi-Mode Transport Hub in the land where the Manning Market is presently situated, as proposed under the  Western Region Megapolis Plan.  The construction work necessary for removing around 1,200 traders within the Manning Market at present and relocating them in a land belonging to the State Engineering Corporation is underway. However, since a need has arisen for the commencement of the construction work of the proposed Multi-Mode Transport Hub without any delay, until the completion of the said relocation work, it has become necessary to relocate the traders of the Manning Market expeditiously in another land.  As such, the joint proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development and Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to get an adjoining plot of land of about 06 acres belonging to the State Engineering Corporation situated in the Peliyagoda area, on lease basis, for a period of 03 years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
