  "decision_details": "- The National Hospital of Sri Lanka comprising of 3,300 beds and situated in a 32 acre land in Colombo is the largest hospital in the South East Asia. The Out Patients Department of the Hospital maintained in the same building where it was first established in the year 1948 and the infrastructure facilities found are inadequate to provide the necessary facilities for over 5,000 patients coming to the Department daily for treatment. As such, it has been planned to construct a new Out Patients Department Complex at the Sri Lanka National Hospital as an award of the the Republic of China.  Accordingly,  the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to enter into an Agreement with the Republic of China to implement the project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
