  "decision_details": "- Since, training in a high altitude increases the endurance ability of sports men and women, it is beneficial to conduct outdoor and indoor training in such a background. While emphasizing the need of a high altitude training centre for the Sri Lankan sports men and women, the Government has focused its attention on the construction of a high altitude sports complex in the Nuwara Eliya District situated 1,895 Meters above the mean sea level to meet the needs of the sports men and women of Sri Lanka and to provide high altitude training at international level for the sports men and women of the neighbouring countries as well, with a view to earning foreign exchange.  Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Dayasiri Jayasekara, the Minister of Sports, for the Government of Sri Lanka to enter into an Agreement, with a French Company selected from the project proposals received to construct the  Nuwara Eliya High Altitude Sports Complex, was approved by the Cabinet.",
