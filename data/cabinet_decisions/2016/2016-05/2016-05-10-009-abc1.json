  "decision_details": "- Electricity sector of the country is advancing rapidly with the growth of industrial and commercial sectors and the provision of 100% electricity supply in the country through the extension of the electricity grid to rural areas. At present, the household sector and the business sector consume 37% and 27% respectively of the total electricity consumption of the country. A substantial quantity (approximately 30%) of energy consumption of both these sectors is expended in double capped tubular fluorescent lamps and fluorescent lamp ballasts. It is estimated that by introducing energy performance standards to encourage import/manufacture of energy efficient double capped tubular fluorescent lamps and fluorescent lamp ballasts, about 85 GWh of electricity could be saved annually. Accordingly, in order to regulate the quality of the double capped tubular fluorescent lamps and fluorescent lamp ballasts making it mandatory to display such performance standards on energy for the information of the public, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to publish the Energy Performance Standards of Appliances (Double Capped Tubular Fluorescent Lamps and Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts) Regulations in the Government Gazette, in accordance with the powers vested in the Minister under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act, No. 35 of 2007  and to present such regulations thereafter in Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
