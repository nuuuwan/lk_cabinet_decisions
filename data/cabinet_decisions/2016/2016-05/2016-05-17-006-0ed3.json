  "decision_details": "- The Ministry of Housing and Construction is working on preparing  a long term programme, on the instructions of H.E the President and the Hon. Prime Minister, with a view to fulfilling the national housing requirement, which is a major problem encountered by Sri Lanka.   In the process, it is essential to obtain the accurate and updated information on the housing requirement of Sri Lanka.  As a period of 05 years has already lapsed since the  last census on population and housing was conducted, a survey on housing at District and Divisional levels has to be  carried out expeditiously to recognize the present housing requirement in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to secure the assistance of the District, Provincial and Rural level Government officials headed by District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries, to obtain the accurate and updated information/data required to design the National Housing Programme expected to be implemented by the Ministry of  Housing and Construction, with a view to accomplishing all the housing requirements in Sri Lanka, by the year 2025, was approved by the Cabinet.",
