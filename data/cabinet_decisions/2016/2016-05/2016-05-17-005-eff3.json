  "decision_details": "- The subsidy schemes for the Maritime Fishing Industry continuously implemented  by the Government of Sri Lanka since 1950, has been subject to changes in keeping with the topical requirements. The Government has allocated a sum of Rs.1,600 million for the year 2016 to introduce small and medium scale technology for fishing industry and a major portion of these provisions will be utilized to modernize the multiday fishing boats operating in the Exclusive Economic Zone  (EEZ) of the country to be on par with the modern technology. Regulations were imposed in year 2011 making it compulsory to install transponders in offshore multiday boats and the installation of this accessory is essential in issuing fitness certificates for the fishing vessels. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, to provide the fishermen with 2400 transponders  and other  technological equipment required to increase the efficiency and  effectiveness of the fishing industry, for the purpose of ensuring  effective implementation of these regulations, under the subsidy programme implemented by the Government,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
