  "decision_details": "- A Seafarer holding a Certificate of Competency to serve on a ship that flies a flag of a foreign country, is required to obtain a Certificate of Recognition issued by the state in which the relevant ship is registered,  in addition to the Certificate he possesses.  In order to issue such Certificates, the relevant countries should have entered into a Convention or a Memorandum of Understanding and Sri Lanka has already entered into such agreements with 29 countries. Entering into such agreements will pave the way for a considerable number of Sri Lankan Seafarers who hold Certificates of Competency to have job opportunities in foreign vessels. The Government of Portugal has expressed its willingness to enter into an agreement with Sri Lanka pertaining to the issuance of such Certificates and accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Arjuna Ranatunga, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Portugal on Certificates of Recognition issued to Seafarers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
