  "decision_details": "- Although the railway offers transport facilities to passengers at extremely concessionary rates compared to other passenger transport services, it has been reported that a considerable number of railway passengers still evade obtaining tickets and ride in or upon carriages of a higher class than that for which they had paid their fare.  Considering the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to amend the present fine on offences in regard to railway tickets, with a view to providing a safe and efficient railway service, enhancing the revenue of the Department of Railways and discouraging the passengers who travel in trains without obtaining tickets, the Cabinet approved to increase the existing maximum  fine of Rs.1,500/- up to Rs.3,000/-.",
