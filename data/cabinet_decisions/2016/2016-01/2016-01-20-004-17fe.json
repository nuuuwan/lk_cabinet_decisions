  "decision_details": "- The Polonnaruwa District is one of the largest paddy cultivating areas in Sri Lanka and the total extent of paddy cultivating lands exceeds 80,000 acres.  However, in recent past, the paddy cultivation in the district has undergone a set back due to situations such as floods and prolonged dry spells.  To address the issues encountered by the farmers of the Polonnaruwa District, the Irrigation Department has proposed to implement a six year Irrigation Development Plan commencing from the year 2016.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, the Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, to implement the said development plan, at an estimated investment of Rs.7 billion, during the period of six years from 2016 to 2021 under 3 phases, namely, short term, medium term and long term, was approved by the Cabinet.",
