  "decision_details": "- In the Sri Lanka's present Regional Administrative Structure, the smallest administrative unit is the Grama Niladhari Division (GND). At present, there are 14,021 GNDs and such GNDs have been grouped into 331 Divisional Secretariats (DSs) and 25 Districts. However, it has been observed that the general public and such other parties who expect the services of the Government institutions, have to face difficulties due to the establishment of their regional units by the most of such government institutions which provide various services, deviating from the existing administrative boundaries, taking into consideration only the  requirements and comfort of such institutions.  Functioning of 160 Electorates, 336 Local Government Bodies, 340 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas and 311 Education Divisions presently in Sri Lanka, on the basis of geographical boundaries, can be pointed out as examples.  Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to formulate a programme by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, in association with the Ministry of Home Affairs and with the participation of all stakeholders, to remove the existing inconsistencies occurred due to the regional units established by various Government institutions, by rationalizing geographical boundaries on the basis of the Grama Niladhari Division, was approved by the Cabinet.",
