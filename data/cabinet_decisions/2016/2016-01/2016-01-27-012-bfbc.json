  "decision_details": "- Duty-free shops are of special significance in airport mercantile operations and  up to now,  the right to maintain core category duty-free shops at both arrival and departure terminals of the Bandaranaike International Airport, has been granted as a monopoly, to two operators. No Tender procedure or calling for competitive bids,  has been followed in the selection of contractors in this regard.  Therefore, with a view to securing a higher return to the Airport and the Airport and Aviation Services (SL) Limited, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation,  to appoint a Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and a Technical Evaluation Committee, for the purpose of inviting bids in a more transparent manner in compliance with the Tender procedure, for the operation of these shops for a contract period of five years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
