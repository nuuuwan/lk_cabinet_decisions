  "decision_details": "- The resettlement of internally displaced people due to the conflict, in their places of origin is very important in building reconciliation and durable peace.  That fact has also been highlighted in the recommendations of  the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).  Due to non releasement of their lands for resettlement, a considerable number of families in Jaffna District, still live either in the Welfare Centres or with their friends or relatives.  Accordingly, taking into consideration the proposal made by Hon. D.M. Swaminathan, the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the Cabinet approved to gradually release the lands identified as suitable for the resettlement of above families, without causing any hinderance to the national security.",
