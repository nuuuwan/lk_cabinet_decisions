  "decision_details": "- A  formal document on the spread and  extent of diverse resources of minerals in Sri Lanka, has  not yet been prepared. The potential  value of these existing resources has increased, due to reasons such as the creation of  high-end  products through the use of such resources and the expansion of technical knowledge in utilizing the same. Many of the mineral resources available in Sri Lanka are exported without value addition and for this reason,  we have not been able to derive the highest economic benefits  from these resources. Although a one (01) kg of Ilmenite, found in the area of Pulmuddai, yields only Rs.40/-, when it's value-added as pharmaceutical grade Titanium Dioxide, it will receive  Rs.450,000/- per kg. Therefore, considering the above matters, the proposal made by Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Science, Technology and Research, to appoint a Cabinet Sub\u2011Committee, for the purpose of formulating a National Policy for Sri Lanka on Natural Mineral Resources, with a view to  putting an end to the exportation of local mineral resources without any value addition, was approved by the Cabinet.",
