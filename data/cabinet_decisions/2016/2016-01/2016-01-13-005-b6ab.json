  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka is the first Asian country to ratify the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control presented by the World Health Organization (WHO), and became a party to the said Convention in 2003 as the fourth  in the world to do so. The use of tobacco products is a major risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, especially Cardiovascular conditions.  It has been confirmed that a considerable percentage of illicit tobacco products is available in Sri Lanka, in addition to the registered / licensed tobacco products. There is a tendency of using such illicit products of low cost by the certain members of low income families and minors. This situation poses serious threats on the people's health.  Therefore, the accession to the above protocol would make it possible to  implement an effective controlling mechanism to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine,  for the accession to the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, was approved by the Cabinet.",
