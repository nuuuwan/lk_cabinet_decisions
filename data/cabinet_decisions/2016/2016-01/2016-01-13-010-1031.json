  "decision_details": "- The  Sri Lankan Government's Development Plan to be implemented in the medium term for reaching the developed country status was disclosed through the Economic Policy Statement recently made by Hon. Prime Minister in Parliament.  In order to achieve the objectives expected from the said plan, the existence of an efficient, active and modernized Governmental machinery is an essential factor. The one of the major causes for the higher progress achieved in the economic development recently by the countries such as Singapore and Malaysia is the existence of an efficient and modernized administrative mechanism.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Sarath Amunugama, the Minister of Special Assignments, to recommend the measures to be taken to introduce administrative reforms which create the background for the establishment of such an administrative mechanism in the country, was approved by the Cabinet.",
