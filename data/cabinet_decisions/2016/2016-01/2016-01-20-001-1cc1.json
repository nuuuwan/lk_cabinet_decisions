  "decision_details": "- The Mahaweli Livestock and Agri Business (Pvt) Ltd. established in the year 1999 is a company fully owned by the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. Carrying out activities related to areas such as livestock management, milk production, agri-crop cultivation and providing required knowledge and extension services to the farmers are among the main objectives of establishing this company.  At present, two farms owned by this company are situated in Girandurukotte and Damminna areas.  Consequent to the  changes made in the management and reduction of unnecessary and wasteful expenditure, the company which was running at a loss for a number of years has now reached a status of non-loss making.   However, due to the deterioration of the capital assets and the machinery, a capital  investment is essential for the sustainability of the company.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to select a suitable investor through public-private partnership to conduct the affairs of the company, was approved by the Cabinet.",
