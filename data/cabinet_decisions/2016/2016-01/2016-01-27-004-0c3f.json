  "decision_details": "- The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) was established in the year 1984, with the amalgamation of the Building Research Institution administered by the State Engineering Corporation and the Soil Laboratory of the  Department of Buildings. Then, in 1993, it was reorganized as a separate institution,under the Institute of Construction, Training and Development (ICTAD), of the Ministry of Housing and Construction. This institution mainly depends on its own earnings and acts as the National Centre in the management of landslides and geographical irregularities. The grant of legal recognition, to this organization with more than 25 years of experience, will  enable it to deliver its services in a more excellent manner.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharashana Yapa, the Minister of Disaster Management, to draft necessary legislation to rename this institution, which renders services such as the identification of \u201cat-risk\u201d areas in Sri Lanka, issuance of early warnings, issuance of landslide risk evaluation reports, consultancy services and assessment of damages, as the \u201cNational Building Research Organization\u201d and establish it through an Act of Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
