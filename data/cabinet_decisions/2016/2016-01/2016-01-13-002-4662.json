  "decision_details": "- Buildings are being rapidly constructed within the present development process and it is essential to design such buildings in an eco-friendly manner. For that purpose, the concept of 'Green Buildings' has been introduced to reduce the use of energy, water and other utilities, while creating a healthy atmosphere inside buildings. Thereby, healthy, happy and comfort environment could be created, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the level of air quality internally and externally. Within the development process of Sri Lanka, which has been planned to implement in an eco-friendly manner, action should be taken to make the built environment comfortable and to mitigate the adverse effects on the environment by the building industry. In order to achieve the said target, it has been proposed to launch a programme to construct buildings in Sri Lanka in an eco-freindly manner from the year 2016. Accordingly, the proposal made by H. E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to appoint an Officials Committee to peruse the Guidelines already drafted, for the purpose of construction and maintenance of Government and Semi-government buildings as eco-friendly 'Green Buildings', as an initial step of that programme and to prepare an Action Plan for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
