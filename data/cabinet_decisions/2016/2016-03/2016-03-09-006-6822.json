  "decision_details": "- Anuradhapura, which belongs to the 'Cultural Triangle' of Sri Lanka holds a special significance due to its archaeological specialty and the number of sacred places of Buddhist worship found therein. At the same time, it is the economic and administrative hub of the North Central Province and is a destination which has gained the  attraction of the local and foreign tourists. Presently, a population of more than 51,000 reside in the city limits of Anuradhapura, where a high growth is anticipated in time to come. Therefore, it is proposed to create a balanced growth and co-development between the sacred city and the new town areas of Anuradhapura, under the Strategic Cities Development Project implemented by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, while preserving its cultural and natural heritage.  The improvement of the city water drainage system, provision of public transport facilities, traffic management and the enhancement of public space are anticipated to be carried out through this project. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to implement the Anuradhapura Integrated Urban Development Project, under the Strategic Cities Development Project being implemented and the proposal made by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance, to enter into a loan agreement with the Agence Francaise De Developpment (AFD), to obtain a credit facility of Euro 52 million, were approved by the Cabinet.",
