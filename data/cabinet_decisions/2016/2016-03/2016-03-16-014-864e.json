  "decision_details": "- Mullaitivu belonging to the Northern Province is a district where the lives of the people have been worst affected by the Tsunami and the protracted conflict. Although, a large number of development activities are in progress under the supervision of the District Secretary, to uplift the living conditions of the people of the district, the limited space available in the District Secretariat has become an obstruction to carry out such development activities efficiently and effectively. Accordingly, with a view to providing the services of the District Secretariat under one roof, in order to provide a better service to the people of the district, the proposal made by Hon. Vajira Abeywardena, the Minister of Home Affairs, to carry out the construction work of  the Stage II of the District Secretariat, Mullaitivu at an estimated cost of Rs.328 million,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
