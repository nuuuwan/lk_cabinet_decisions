  "decision_details": "- The introduction of certain alien and invasive species of plants and beings  and their speedy expansion have made a great impact on the agro-ecosystems in Sri Lanka, as well as the economic activities associated with them. Although, there are legal instruments available in Sri Lanka to prevent this state of affairs, when considering the environmental, economic and social harm caused, the importance of a well prepared National Policy for control and management of invasive plants/trees and the prevention of alien species, is a felt need. Therefore, to control the extension of invasive plants/trees and to minimize the harm caused to the bio-diversity, environmental systems and the economy and society, the  proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment to implement the National Invasive Alien Species Policy, Strategies and Action Plan related thereto, formulated in collaboration with the all stakeholders and the experts relating to the field, was approved by the Cabinet.",
