  "decision_details": "- The programme 'Gam Udawa', which was launched successfully in the 1980s as an innovative strategy to reach the poor and under privileged people, in every nook and cranny of the country for the upliftment of their living standards, was implemented on the basis that shelter is fundamental to  physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being of the people.  However, the implementation of 'Gam Udawa' was abandoned during the middle of 1990s. The proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to restore this integrated development effort, which had evolved around the development of human settlements and followed with the 'Gam Udawa' Exhibition, covering a few electorates at regional level, effective from this year, was approved by the Cabinet.",
