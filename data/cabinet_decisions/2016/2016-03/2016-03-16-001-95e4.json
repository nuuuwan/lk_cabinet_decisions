  "decision_details": "- Excessive burning of fossil fuels, industrialization, urbanization, deforestation and environmental pollution have paved the way to the increase of global temperature and it has been predicted that the global temperature is likely to rise by 4 degrees Celcius (4\u00b0C) by the end of this Century. The climate changes that occur due to the increase of global temperature will cause adverse effects to the sustenance of mankind. As per the Paris Agreement entered into at the 21st Session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), which was held in Paris,  France from 30th November to 11th December 2015, it has been agreed not to exceed the global temperature by another 2 degrees Celcius (2\u00b0C)  from the present temperature level by 2100 and to maintain the same below 1.5 degrees Celcius (1.5\u00b0C).  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of  Mahaweli Development and Environment, for Sri Lanka to sign the Paris Agreement in concurrence with the above to formulate the policies and plans relevant to implement the set of proposals for the reduction of Green House Gas emissions  as designed for the contribution of Sri Lanka as per the said Agreement, to draft legislation for the establishment of the 'Climate Change Commission of Sri Lanka' and to implement the ''Blue Green Beautiful Lanka' Programme, in 10,000 villages, during the period of 2016-2020, in collaboration with the community organizations, with a view to creating eco-friendly 'Green Smart Villages', was approved by the Cabinet.",
