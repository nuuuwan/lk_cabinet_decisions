  "decision_details": "- It has been planned to establish an Advanced Technological Institute (ATI) in each district, in order to accomplish the tasks entrusted with the Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education (SLIATE), which is functioning under the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways. Eleven (11) Advanced Technological Institutes and six (06) Advanced Technological Institute Sections are presently being operated under the SLIATE and there is a very high recognition for the Higher National Diplomas awarded by the Institute. Only about 35% of the students was enrolled out of more than 20,000 students who have applied for the courses in 2015, due to insufficient space available.  Hence, the opportunity has been limited for the students to have  advanced technological education on the fields such as Engineering, Quantity Surveying, English Language and Information Technology which possess a higher demand in the current job market.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, to implement the projects for the development of buildings, equipment, staff and the student capacity of the Advanced Technological Institutes situated in Kegalle, Dehiwala, Jaffna, Galle, Gampaha, Kandy, Kurunegala and Sammanthurai, at an estimated cost of Rs. 2,368.5 million, as a solution to this situation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
