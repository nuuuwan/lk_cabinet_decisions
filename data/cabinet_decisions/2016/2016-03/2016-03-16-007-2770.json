  "decision_details": "- Kalmunai Town can be described as one of the most affected towns from the Tsunami disaster that occurred in the year 2004. The families displaced from the said disaster have been resettled in a three storied housing complex comprising of 174 housing units, which was constructed utilizing a sum of money given by a private donor, in a plot of land purchased by the Urban Development Authority, for the resettlement of displaced families. The proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to allocate the relevant land as a free grant to the National Housing Development Authority (NHDA) by the Urban Development Authority, enabling the NHDA to legally allocate the said housing units to the residents of such housing units through issuing deeds to them and also to take necessary measures to manage common amenities of the said housing scheme, providing solutions  to the issues encountered by the residents due to absence of a proper mechanism for the maintenance of this housing scheme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
