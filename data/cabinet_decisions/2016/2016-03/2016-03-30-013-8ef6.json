  "decision_details": "- It is envisaged that an average of about 1000 GWh power can be saved within the next five (05) years and avoid the need for the construction of 500 MW power stations by educating the public on the frugal use of electricity, the use of electrical equipment and technology and the change of various economic and social patterns. Therefore, a programme has been prepared with the collaboration of the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Lanka Electricity (Pvt) Company and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority for the promotion of efficient use of electricity and its conservation. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to appoint a Presidential Task Force  and a National Operational Committee to implement the said programme with a wide participation of the domestic, commercial and industry sector as well as the Public Sector, was approved by the Cabinet.",
