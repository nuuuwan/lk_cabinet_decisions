  "decision_details": "- It has been proposed to construct an elevated highway network in Colombo, in order to improve the connectivity between the Colombo city, suburbs and expressways, and to reduce the prevailing traffic congestion. Under this network, it is proposed to construct an elevated highway of 6.9 km in length with four lanes, commencing from the proposed New Kelani Bridge and ending at Rajagiriya. This section will be extended towards the Southern direction enabling it to connect with the Outer Circular Highway at Athurugiriya. And also, the Northern end of this section of the proposed elevated highway will  be linked with the Katunayake Expressway at the New Kelani Bridge. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.
