  "decision_details": "- The Development Plan prepared by the Urban Development Authority for Horana Town has identified the issues regarding the inadequacy of infrastructure, traffic congestion and improper land use pattern in the Central Business Area and the basic requirements for the development of the city. To upgrade the Central Business Area, it is absolutely necessary to develop the existing bus stand with adequate parking space for the large number of buses operating to and fro to provide the necessary facilities for the people who come to the city. Stage I of this bus stand has already been completed and therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development to proceed with Stage II of the bus stand development project which includes small scale shop spaces, sanitary facilities, bus shelter access facilities  and access road improvement facilities at a cost of Rs.182 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
