  "decision_details": "- The Constitution has guaranteed the right of every citizen to  communicate with the Government in one's own mother tongue.  Although, the Government has taken various steps to enforce this right from time to time, there still exists a considerable dearth of officers in the public institutions who have the ability to work in the two official languages namely Sinhala and Tamil (bilingual) and the three languages namely Sinhala, English and Tamil (trilingual). The proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena for the  establishment of a database of resource persons with bilingual/trilingual competency, at district level, as an interim measure and to make such information in the database open to all public institutions, non-governmental institutions and the general public and to get their services to public institutions, at instances where necessary,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
