  "decision_details": "- Measures have been taken by now to grant the allowance of Rs.6000/- each for purchasing stationery for school children in Aswesuma beneficiary families, through the bank accounts of the said families. Providing the said allowance to children who have lost their parents and not belonging to Aswesuma beneficiary families, children from families with a disabled mother or father, all children of school age in orphanages and children belonging to the categories of destitution due to special reasons, have been entrusted with the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education. The Cabinet, taking into account the non-availability of an updated database as of now, to select children from families belonging to aforesaid categories, and the need to provide the proposed Stationary Allowance at the beginning of the new school term in 2025, approved the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education to grant the Stationery Allowance of Rs.6,000/- each, to all children from families that are not beneficiaries of Aswesuma in 6,576 schools with less than 300 children out of the total of 10,096 schools across the Island, children coming to schools from Child Development Centres and lay and monastic students in Pirivena and provide the said allowance through a voucher.",
