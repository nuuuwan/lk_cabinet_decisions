  "decision_details": "- Approval has been granted at the Cabinet Meeting held on 2024\u201101\u201124 to amend or delete the obsolete provisions of the Exchange Ordinance No.25 of 1927 (Chapter 82). Accordingly, the Cabinet at its meeting held on 2024\u201107\u201115 has granted approval to publish the Bills of Exchange Ordinance (Amendment) Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman in the Government Gazette and submit the same thereafter to Parliament. Nevertheless, the said Bill could not be submitted to Parliament due to the dissolution of Parliament on 2024\u201109\u201124. As such, taking into consideration the joint proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development and the Minister of Justice and National Integration, the Cabinet decided to grant policy approval for the Bills of Exchange Ordinance (Amendment) Bill and re-publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and submit the same thereafter to Parliament.",
