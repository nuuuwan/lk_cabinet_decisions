  "decision_details": "- Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. has been incorporated in December 2011, to invest in the Tourism/Hospitality sector. SinoLanka Hotels & Spa (Pvt) Ltd. has been established to implement the 'Grand Hyatt, Colombo' project, which is an investment of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. The approval has been granted by the then Cabinet for the divestiture of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. under the 'State Owned Enterprise Restructuring Programme' and to select M/s Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP as the Transaction Advisor for the said purpose. However, no further steps have been taken accordingly. It is currently estimated, that approximately USD 120 million (approximately Rs. 36 billion) will be required further to complete the 'Grand Hyatt, Colombo' project. Taking into consideration the difficulty in obtaining further funds from the shareholders of the said company or through debt financing to complete the construction of the project, the most appropriate option that has been identified is raising the necessary funds through a process of selling shares of the company and completing the construction of the project and thereafter commencing the commercial operations. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to resume the divestiture process of Canwill Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. and to further obtain the service of M/s Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP as the Transaction Advisor for the same, was approved by the Cabinet.",
