  "decision_details": "- Approval has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2025-01-27, to prepare a Bill to liquidate the existing Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) and establish the Digital Economy Authority. In order to accelerate digital transformation and establish an institutional framework for digital economic development in Sri Lanka in parallel to the same, the experiences of implementing the existing digital strategies in Sri Lanka and other countries have been studied. Accordingly, the necessity of a stable and well-defined institutional structure to achieve the desired objectives of the National Digital Strategies has been identified. Taking these matters into consideration, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Digital Economy, to establish a State-Owned company named 'GovTech (Pvt) Limited' as an independent institution with the necessary authorities, enabling the smooth implementation of digital transformation projects that have already been initiated and to be initiated in the future, was approved by the Cabinet.",
