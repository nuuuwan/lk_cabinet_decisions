  "decision_details": "- The Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2025, has introduced legal provisions to increase the Withholding Tax rate from 5% to 10%, with effect from 2025-04-01. It has been observed that due to the imposition of Withholding Tax even on individuals with income not exceeding the annual taxable income limit of Rs.1.8 million, such depositors and low-income individuals are facing inconveniences. As a solution to the said problem, it has been proposed to introduce a system for submitting a self-declaration for individuals with income below the tax-free threshold. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to amend the Inland Revenue Act, No.24 of 2017, incorporating the appropriate amendments to introduce a self-declaration for all resident individuals whose assessable income does not exceed Rs. 1.8 million per annum to relieve from the deduction of Withholding Tax on interest and to make it mandatory to furnish the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) for opening all types of bank accounts, was approved by the Cabinet.",
