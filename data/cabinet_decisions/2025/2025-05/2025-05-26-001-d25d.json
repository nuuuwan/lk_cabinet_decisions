  "decision_details": "- Currently, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Port City Economic Commission operate to provide necessary facilities for investors in Sri Lanka. However, taking into consideration the fact that a proper and investor-friendly research and development mechanism has not been formally established for identification of projects related to research and development commercialization and evaluation and empowerment of its technical and economic potential, the \"National Initiative for Research and Development Commercialization (NIRDC)\" has been established under the Presidential Secretariat. The main objective of establishing this Initiative is to provide facilities for investors who wish to introduce the projects where researches have already been completed or nearly completed to the market as value added vendible products or Service. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to appoint a Technical Evaluation Committee comprising of experts with expertise in technology, education, science, health, environment, food and sustainability, social development, wellbeing and other disciplines to evaluate the project proposals forwarded to the National Initiative for Research and Development Commercialization for commercialization and refer the same to suitable investors, was approved by the Cabinet.",
