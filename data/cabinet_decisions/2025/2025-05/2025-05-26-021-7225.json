  "decision_details": "- The key responsibility of the Government revenue collection mechanism in Sri Lanka is held by the three institutions; the Inland Revenue Department, the Sri Lanka Customs and the Excise Department of Sri Lanka. At present, these three Departments are facing challenges such as fragmented operations, inefficiencies due to outdated processes and legal systems, revenue leakages, digitization-oriented insufficiency, lack of inter-agency coordination in policy implementation and integrity issues. It has been proposed under the macroeconomic stabilization fiscal policies mentioned in the manifesto 'A Thriving Nation - A Beautiful Life', to establish a new unit to plan and implement tax policies with a special section to deal with international transactions. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to establish a special Bureau in the name of 'Revenue Administration Reform and Modernization Bureau' under the Presidential Secretariat in line with international best practices to strengthen the government revenue administration mechanism by overcoming the existing challenges, was approved by the Cabinet.",
