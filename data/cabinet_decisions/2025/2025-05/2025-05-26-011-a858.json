  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka, as a member of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, is committed to effectively implement and enforce the internationally accepted standards against money laundering, financing of terrorism and proliferation financing developed by the Financial Action Task Force. Further, in accordance with the membership rules of the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, Sri Lanka is subjected to a mutual peer review process called as \"Mutual Evaluations\" every 6 years to determine the level of compliance with the standards of the Financial Action Task Force. As per the Action Plan prepared for the 3rd Evaluation relating to Sri Lanka, the Ministry in charge of the subject of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence are required to promptly promulgate the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014) on Foreign Terrorist Fighters and to enforce the provisions of the said Resolution by way of domestic legislation. Accordingly, Sri Lanka is obligated to make legislation on Foreign Terrorist Fighters before March 2026. Therefore, the joint proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to counter Foreign Terrorist Fighters based on the UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014), was approved by the Cabinet.",
