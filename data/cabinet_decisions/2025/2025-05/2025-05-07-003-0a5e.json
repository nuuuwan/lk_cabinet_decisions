  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology Private Limited has been established for research and technology transfer based on nanotechnology. Similarly, Sri Lanka Institute of Biotechnology Private Limited has been established with the primary objective of promoting biotechnology exports and creating import substitution products through biotechnology-related research. Under the current domestic and global economic and political trends, it has been identified as appropriate to restructure the two institutions, so that they can contribute more to the rapid economic growth of Sri Lanka through a nanotechnology and biotechnology research and development approach. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Science and Technology to appoint an Expert Committee to review the functioning of Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology Private Limited and Sri Lanka Institute of Biotechnology Private Limited and submit a Report with recommendations regarding the reforms to be made to their legal structure and strategic plans, was approved by the Cabinet.",
