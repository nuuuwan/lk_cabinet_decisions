  "decision_details": "- It has been proposed through the election manifesto of the present Government to introduce an Office of the Public Prosecutor as a mechanism to prevent delays within the judicial system and establish an independent Office of the Public Prosecutor and Provincial Sub Offices, operating separately from the Attorney General's Department to conduct cases on behalf of the Government. It is expected to improve the independence and transparency of the criminal justice system and expedite the criminal justice process, enabling to gain confidence of the people. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in her final report on Sri Lanka submitted in September 2024, has also proposed establishing an independent prosecutional authority as a matter of urgency. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice and National Integration to appoint a Committee of Technical Experts chaired by Justice Yasantha Kodagoda, President's Counsel, Judge of the Supreme Court, to examine and report on introducing new legislation for the establishment of such an office, and to make recommendations to introduce necessary amendments to the laws currently in force, where found necessary, was approved by the Cabinet.",
