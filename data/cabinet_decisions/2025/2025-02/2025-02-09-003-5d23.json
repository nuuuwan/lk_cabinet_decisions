  "decision_details": "- The digitization of the documents of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka, aiming to improve its efficiency, accuracy and accessibility, has been identified as an essential step towards the administration and enforcement of intellectual property in the country. It is expected that, through the introduction of online registration facilities, electronic filing and record-keeping systems, digitization of archived records and online communication platforms under such digitization programmes, more reliable, faster and user-friendly intellectual property service will be ensured. Accordingly, the operations of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka will be facilitated to be carried out more efficiently and effectively. The World Intellectual Property Organization has agreed to provide a technical and services grant worth Rs.70.2 million for the implementation of the said project. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development to implement the project to digitize the documents of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka and to sign a Cooperation Agreement with the World Intellectual Property Organization to obtain the proposed grant, was approved by the Cabinet.",
