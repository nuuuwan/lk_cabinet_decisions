  "decision_details": "- The National Productivity Organization was established after Sri Lanka becoming a member of the Asian Productivity Organization in 1966, and the National Productivity Secretariat was established in 1994 to further expand its functions. The National Productivity Awards Competition was announced in 2003, with the objectives of encouraging institutions to adopt good practices to improve quality, productivity and service, directing public institutions to improve the living standards of citizens in line with the national vision and development programme, identifying exemplary institutions and evaluating them at the national level, and preparing public institutions to face future global challenges for sustainable development through the use of resources economically. The said competition has been held 10 times from 2006 to 2020, and it has not been held after 2020. The proposal made by the Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development to hold the National Productivity Awards Competition under the main categories of Schools, Government, Manufacturing and Services from the year 2025/26 as a strategic tool to achieve the objectives of the present Government's 'Clean Sri Lanka' National Project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
