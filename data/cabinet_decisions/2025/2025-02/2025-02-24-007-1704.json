  "decision_details": "- One in six people of the total population of Sri Lanka is currently affected by multidimensional poverty, and 95.3% out of the said population lives in rural and estate areas. The comments made in this regard indicate that no party is satisfied with the end result of the poverty alleviation programmes implemented in Sri Lanka so far. Over the last few decades, the number of beneficiaries and the amount of money spent on poverty alleviation welfare programmes have gradually increased. By the year 2000, the number of beneficiaries was 1.10 million, and by the year 2010, that number had increased up to 1.57 million. By the year 2024, that number has further increased up to 1.79 million. Since the continuation of this situation will adversely affect the economic and production process of the country, a systematically planned programme has to be implemented to direct only the vulnerable groups to a proper social security programme and involve the rest as active participants in the economic process. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment to implement the \"Praja Shakthi\" programme as an integrated program with a multiple approach, enabling to achieve the vision 'A Prosperous Country - A Secured Life' in line with the manifesto of the new government, was approved by the Cabinet.",
