  "decision_details": "- The Secretary to the Ministry of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development and the Secretary to the Ministry of Plantations and Community Infrastructure were directed at the Cabinet meeting held on 2025-01-27 to look into the possibility of expeditiously importing coconut kernel and other raw materials related to coconut kernel that are required for industries that use coconut as raw materials, adhering to the legal provisions currently in force, enabling to temporarily utilize more local coconut yield as a solution to the shortage of coconuts that has arisen in the market for local consumption due to insufficient coconut production in the country. Accordingly, Guidelines have been prepared and submitted in respect of the importation of frozen coconut kernels and dehydrated coconut chips with brown outer skin (not copra), coconut milk/ coconut milk powder and desiccated coconut, in association with the Department of Agriculture, Coconut Research Institute, Coconut Development Authority, National Plant Quarantine Service and Sri Lanka Standards Institution. The joint proposal made by the Minister of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development and the Minister of Plantations and Community Infrastructure to take necessary steps to import coconut kernel-related products equivalent to 200 million coconuts and dehydrated coconut chips with brown outer skin (non-copra) for the production of coconut oil, following the said guidelines, was approved by the Cabinet.",
