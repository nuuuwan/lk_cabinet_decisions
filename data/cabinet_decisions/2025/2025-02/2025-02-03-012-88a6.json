  "decision_details": "- Provisions in respect of leave of public officers are included in Chapter XII, Volume I of the Establishments Code. Leave may be granted to an officer as per the provisions of sub-section 8:5, Chapter XII of the Establishments Code, who applies again for a leave to be spent out of the Island before completing a continuous service period of 09 months after reporting for duty at the end of the period of leave spent out of the Island, only if he has not already availed himself of any vacation leave of that year. According to the said provisions, an officer could leave the Island for personal reasons only twice in a calendar year. Since the public officers go abroad for short periods for official purposes as well as for personal reasons, it is observed that various problems are encountered when implementing the provisions of sub-section 8:5 of Chapter XII, Volume I of the Establishments Code. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government to revise sub-section 8:5 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code enabling an officer who wishes to take foreign leave again in the same year he has reported for duty after a leave spent outside the country, to avail himself of the remaining vacation leave entitled for the year in which such leave is taken, was approved by the Cabinet.",
