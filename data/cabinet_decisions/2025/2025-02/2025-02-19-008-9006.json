  "decision_details": "- The Galle Water Supply Scheme currently provides services to about 28,000 water consumers and new water connections have been suspended due to insufficient water supply. About 5,400 applicants are currently on the waiting list seeking new water connections. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board or the Government is not in a position at the moment to secure funds of about Rs.40.5 billion to implement a new water supply scheme to meet the said requirement. Therefore, the Water Supply and Drainage Board has proposed to implement a pilot project through a performance-based contract under private sector participation, to reduce the current level of non-revenue water consumption, which is currently at 45%, up to 15% and to provide the conserved water accordingly to the applicants on the waiting list. The Asian Development Bank has agreed to provide the necessary consultancy services for the proposed pilot project and has also expressed its willingness to provide a grant of US$ 1.28 million for it. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Housing for the implementation of the said project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
