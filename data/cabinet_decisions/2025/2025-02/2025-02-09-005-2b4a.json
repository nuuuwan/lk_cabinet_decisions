  "decision_details": "- The Employees' Provident Fund, the largest superannuation fund in Sri Lanka, currently has a total of 21.5 million member accounts and around 77,000 active employers remitting contributions. The total assets of the Fund at the end of October 2024 is Rs.4.2 trillion and has achieved continuous growth in the last few years with an annual growth in its assets exceeding 9%. For the smooth functioning of the Employees' Provident Fund, the need for an Information Technology System capable of handling a large number of user accounts and large volumes of data to process a large number of transactions with maximum efficiency has been identified. Accordingly, a project has been started in the year 2021 under the Financial Sector Modernization Project of the World Bank Group to create a new Employees' Provident Fund Management System, and the design and necessary specifications of the new management system have been completed under the consultancy of PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Limited in India. The proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to commence the procurement process to select a System Integrator to implement the proposed project, taking into consideration the said matters, was approved by the Cabinet.",
