  "decision_details": "- The present Government has identified the development of rural roads as a priority task in the Government\u2019s development agenda and has planned to introduce a comprehensive approach for the renovation, construction and maintenance of roads. Accordingly, since many roads in the Northern and Eastern provinces are in a dilapidated condition, it has been decided to give priority to the development of 1,500 km of roads in the Northern Province and 500 km of roads in the Eastern Province, covering every Divisional Secretariat Division. The participation of the public, community-based organizations and local authorities will be taken in selecting the roads for rehabilitation and improvement, and the approval of the relevant Divisional Coordinating Committee and the District Coordinating Committee will be taken for the list of recommended roads. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to implement the proposed Rural Road Improvement Program in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, was approved by the Cabinet.",
