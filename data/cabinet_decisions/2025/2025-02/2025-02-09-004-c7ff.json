  "decision_details": "- Although the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has made multiple attempts to modernize and upgrade the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery to meet market demands in terms of both quantity and quality, they have not been successful. Although Cabinet approval has been granted to establish the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery as a State Owned Enterprise, separate from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and to explore the feasibility of and take the necessary steps for establishing a new oil refinery in the Trincomalee area in collaboration with a suitable strategic partner, no measures have been taken in this regard to date. Under the present Government's Energy Policy Framework, modernization of the existing refinery or the construction of a new refinery has been identified as a priority activity. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has granted approval to call for Expressions of Interest to identify a suitable investment partner based on the feasibility study carried out in the year 2022. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Energy to call for Expressions of Interest to identify and select suitable financiers/investors to implement the project to develop the Sapugaskanda refinery and to establish a new refinery with the capacity of 100,000 barrels per day on Build, Operate and Transfer basis in the same site, and to call for proposals from the entities fulfilling the qualifications, was approved by the Cabinet.",
