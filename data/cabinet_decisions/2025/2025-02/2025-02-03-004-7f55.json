  "decision_details": "- The district and divisional administrative mechanism is still functioning on the basis of the Ordinances enacted during the British colonial era and the Acts and Regulations enacted by the Parliament of Sri Lanka during the period from 1950 to 1970. The transportation and communication systems were not well developed during the said period and it is observed that the certain rules and regulations formulated by then are not compatible with the current conditions thus, hindering the provision of an effective and efficient service to the clients. Therefore, the necessary legal and administrative reforms should be carried out expeditiously to remove the obstacles existing in the rules, regulations and procedures in force to be in line with the current public service requirements and enabling to fulfill the public needs efficiently. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government to appoint a Committee headed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government and consisting of  other relevant officers to obtain a Report with recommendations on the amendments to be made to the existing rules, regulations and procedures, after obtaining the views and suggestions from the relevant officials and the general public, was approved by the Cabinet.",
