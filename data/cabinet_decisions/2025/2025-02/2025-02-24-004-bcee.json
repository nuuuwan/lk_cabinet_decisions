  "decision_details": "- The Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts relating to the International Civil Aviation (Beijing Convention, 2010) criminalizing acts such as the use of civil aircraft for the purpose of causing death, serious bodily injury or serious damage, use of  civil aircraft to release or discharge any biological, chemical or nuclear weapon and the use of  any biological, chemical or nuclear weapon or similar substance on board or against a civil aircraft, was passed at the International Conference on Air Law held in Beijing on 2010 09 10. Since the provisions of the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation Act No.31 of 1996 which is in force in the country at present do not cover such crimes, approval has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2022 05 02 to prepare a Bill to enact the Beijing Convention. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to obtain policy approval of the present Government, enabling to finalize expeditiously the preparation of the said Bill, was approved by the Cabinet.",
