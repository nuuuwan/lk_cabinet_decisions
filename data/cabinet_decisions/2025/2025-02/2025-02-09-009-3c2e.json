  "decision_details": "- The Paddy Marketing Board Act, No. 14 of 1971 provides provisions required for the establishment of a Board to carry on the business of purchasing, selling, supplying, milling, hulling and processing paddy and rice and legal provisions on incidental matters pertaining to the supply of related services. Although 54 years have passed since the enactment of the said Act in 1971, it is still in operation as an outdated Act with no amendments made to it. Since it takes a long period of time to update the provisions of the said Act so as suit the present day requirements, it has been decided to immediately amend the relevant provisions of the Act to introduce a licensing system to regulate the irregular stockpiling and storage of paddy and rice, which has been identified as an existing problem. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to take necessary action to amend the Paddy Marketing Board Act, No. 14 of 1971, was approved by the Cabinet.",
