  "decision_details": "- The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No.48 of 1979 was enacted to address the threats to national security and public order prevailed at that time. Later, an interim measure was taken to promulgate a comprehensive legislation on national security by introducing amendments to the said Act as the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No.12 of 2022. Subsequently, a Bill had been prepared on counter terrorism and the said Bill had been challenged in the Supreme Court. Accordingly, an amending Bill had been prepared by the Legal Draftsman by identifying further amendments to be made to the said Bill and incorporating the said amendments. The proposal made by the Minister of Justice and National Integration to appoint a Committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Rienzie Arsekularatne, P.C. to further study the final draft prepared by the Legal Draftsman and submit suitable proposals to further improve the said Bill, was approved by the Cabinet.",
