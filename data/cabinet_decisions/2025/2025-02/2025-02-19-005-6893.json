  "decision_details": "- It is considered that providing temporary care and protection to female victims of gender-based violence and their children is a duty to be performed by the Government. Accordingly, shelters are being maintained in 10 Districts under the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) jointly bear the expenses of those shelters. A new shelter has also been established in the Nuwara Eliya District since January 2025. The proposal made by the Minister of Women and Child Affairs to include the said temporary shelter for women as well, into the network of shelters maintained jointly with the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and NGOs, was approved by the Cabinet.",
