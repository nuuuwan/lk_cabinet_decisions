  "decision_details": "- The \u201cSarusara\u201d New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme has been introduced to meet the working capital needs of micro and small scale farmers who are engaged in cultivating short-term crops and home gardening and the said scheme had been implemented by the Regional Development Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka since 2020. The Central Bank is unable to implement such concessional credit schemes as per the provisions of the new Central Bank Act which was recently passed by Parliament. Therefore, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to implement the \u201cSarusara\u201d New Comprehensive Rural Credit Scheme as an annual programme by the Department of Development Finance of the General Treasury from the year 2025, was approved by the Cabinet.",
