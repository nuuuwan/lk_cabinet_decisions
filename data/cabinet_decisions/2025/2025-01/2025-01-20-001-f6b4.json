  "decision_details": "- The first batch of medical students of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Moratuwa, enrolled based on the 2019 G.C.E. (Advanced Level) results, is scheduled to commence hospital-based clinical training in July 2025. The Cabinet had granted approval previously for the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Moratuwa using the existing facilities at the premises of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the use of the facilities of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital for hospital-based training of medical students. However, it has been observed that using Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital for clinical professorial training of medical students of the University of Moratuwa is problematic, due to the insufficient number of patients receiving treatment at the said hospital and the diversity of their diseases, and the shortage of hospital staff and specialist doctors. Therefore, the joint proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education; and the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation, to utilize the Kalutara Teaching Hospital and the Gallassa Maternity and Children's Hospital to ensure that a quality hospital-based training is provided to the said medical students, and to vest 02 plots of land belonging to the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the Road Development Authority in the Nagoda West Grama Niladhari Division of the Kalutara Divisional Secretariat Division, with the said University for the establishment of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Moratuwa, was approved by the Cabinet.",
