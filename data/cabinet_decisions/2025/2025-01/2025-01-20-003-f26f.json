  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet, at its meeting held on 2024\u201108\u201105, has granted approval to relocate the unauthorized dwellers within the railway reservation from the Loco Junction, Maligawatta to Padukka Railway Station under the Railway Efficiency Improvement Project, having provided them with housing or compensation. Accordingly, the settlement in 694 houses purchased from housing complexes owned by the Urban Development Authority has already been completed and another 144 housing units are due to be received from the Urban Development Authority. A housing complex with 120 housing units is being constructed in a land owned by the Railway Department in Malapalla, Kottawa for the re-settlement of unauthorized dwellers in Maharagama, Homagama and Padukka areas where no housing scheme of the Urban Development Authority is available and their construction is nearing completion as of now. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to vest the land located at Malapalla, Kottawa owned by the Department of Sri Lanka Railways, together with the housing complex standing thereon, with the National Housing Development Authority as a free grant as per the provisions of section 6(1) of the State Land Ordinance, enabling to grant deeds to the beneficiaries to be settled in the said housing complex and to implement the programme for providing the relevant deeds to the selected beneficiaries without being a burden to them, was approved by the Cabinet.",
