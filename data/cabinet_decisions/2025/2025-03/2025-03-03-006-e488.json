  "decision_details": "- The Health System Enhancement Project has been implemented in two (02) phases with the Asian Development Bank funding, aiming to improve the efficiency, equity and responsiveness of the Primary Healthcare System in the Central, North Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. The original financing for the project consists of a loan of US$ 37.5 million and a grant of US$ 12.5 million. In addition, a loan of US$ 110 million and a grant of US$ 3 million have been obtained as additional financing of the project. The need to extend the validity period of the loan and grant obtained under the original financing for the project by another year has been identified in order to fully utilize the said loan and the grant. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Health and Mass Media to extend the validity period of the original loan and grant of the Health System Enhancement Project up to 2025\u201111\u201130 and the date of closure of the loan up to 2026\u201105\u201131, was approved by the Cabinet.",
