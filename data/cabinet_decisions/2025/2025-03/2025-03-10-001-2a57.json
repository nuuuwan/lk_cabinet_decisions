  "decision_details": "- In keeping with the Regulations issued under the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act, changes in the design of vehicles and their modifications could be made with the prior approval of the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic. Accordingly, by amending the Motor Traffic (Construction of Vehicles) Regulations published in 1983, from time to time, Regulations regarding the manner in which such modifications can be made, have been published through Gazette Notifications. In addition to the installation of vehicle accessories and changes in the design published through such Regulations in the past, the Department of Motor Traffic has also prepared a set of guidelines for decoration of buses and modification of components through different internal procedures and an internal circular too has been issued thereon. However, no Regulations related thereto have been published in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act. Therefore, Cabinet decided to grant its concurrence for the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to appoint a Committee representing the Ministry of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation including other relevant parties, to examine the possible impact of bus decorations and accessories on the safety of passengers travelling in buses, taking all these circumstances into account and submit a Report with recommendations for taking appropriate measures in this regard.",
