  "decision_details": "- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a political and economic union of 10 countries in Southeast Asia. It includes some of the fastest growing economies in the world and these countries contribute approximately 6.5% of the global GDP. Sri Lanka currently maintains diplomatic relations with all ASEAN member countries, however, it is also observed that a strong relationship with ASEAN is essential for shared economic progress. Although it is not possible for non-Southeast Asian countries to get the membership of ASEAN, the ASEAN can confer the status of \"Sectoral Dialogue Partner\" to an external country based on its ability to contribute to the objectives of the ASEAN. Eventhough Sri Lanka has submitted a Letter of Intent for Sectoral Dialogue Partnership and a proposal to achieve the objectives at ASEAN in 2019 to the ASEAN Secretariat, no further action has been taken in that regard. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism to submit a new work/activity plan by Sri Lanka with clear time lines pertaining to the Letter of Intent submitted in 2019 following the process outlined by ASEAN for an external party to obtain the status of an \"ASEAN Sectoral Dialogue Partner\", was approved by the Cabinet.",
