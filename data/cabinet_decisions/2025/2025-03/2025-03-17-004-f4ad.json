However, neither the appointment of a National Tariff Policy Committee for that purpose nor the determination of functions of the said Committee has been made. The proposed Terms of Reference for the National Tariff Policy Committee have been formulated by the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development for the said Terms of Reference and for the appointment of the National Tariff Policy Committee headed by a Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, was approved by the Cabinet.",
