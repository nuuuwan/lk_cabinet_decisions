  "decision_details": "- The Anti-Corruption Act, No.9 of 2023 has broadened the role of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption from investigation of bribery and corruption-related offenses and prosecution to the implementation and regulation of anti-corruption policies to eliminate bribery and corruption across country. As the Government's \"Clean Sri Lanka\" programme strives to elevate the Sri Lankan society to a higher level of ethical development, the need to formulate and implement a robust national anti corruption policy including all sectors has been identified. Further, as specified in the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, an Anti Corruption Framework needs to be prepared and implemented. Moreover, a robust Anti-Corruption Framework has to be implemented to meet certain global commitments. In line with the obligations under Article 5 of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, Sri Lanka's first National Action Plan against Bribery or Corruption has been implemented during the period 2019-2023. Reviewing the said Action Plan, a new National Anti Corruption Action Plan for the period 2025-2029 has been prepared with the participation of local and international stakeholders. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to implement the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan - 2025 -2029 in collaboration with the Ministries, Departments, all Government Institutions and other relevant stakeholders, was approved by the Cabinet.",
