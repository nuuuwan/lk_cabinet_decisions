  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that the establishment of in-house firefighting units with modern fire fighting equipment in Export Processing Zones operating under the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka could build confidence among investors and minimize damage by protecting employees and properties of industries through immediate responses. For that purpose, the Japanese Government has agreed to provide 4 firefighting vehicles with a capacity of 4000 liters each and 12 sets of equipment for Katunayake, Biyagama, Seethawaka and Wathupitiwala Export Processing Zones through a Grant of Japanese Yen 300 million (approximately 590 million Rupees) under the Economic and Social Development Programme of the Government of Japan. The coordination and implementation of this Project is to be carried out by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka with the technical collaboration of the Fire Department of the Colombo Municipal Council. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to sign the relevant Exchange of Notes and other documents to obtain the proposed Grant, was approved by the Cabinet.",
