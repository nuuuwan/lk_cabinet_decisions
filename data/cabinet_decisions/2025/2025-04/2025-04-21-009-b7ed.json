  "decision_details": "- The Government anticipates to achieve an economic growth rate over 5% of the real Gross Domestic Production (GDP) over the medium term. The Government has focused its attention on investment-friendly policy formulation, infrastructure development and export diversification to achieve sustainable economic growth and economic stability. However, since private investment has been at a low level over the past few decades and the Government investment is about 4%-5% of the GDP, it has been identified that promoting private sector investment is essential to achieve the targeted economic growth. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to establish the Cabinet Appointed Special Committee on Economic Management to oversee and facilitate policy discussions on economic development, ensuring efficiency and alignment with national economic objectives, was approved by the Cabinet.",
