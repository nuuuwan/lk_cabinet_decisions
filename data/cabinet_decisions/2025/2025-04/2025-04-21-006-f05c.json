  "decision_details": "- With the use of rechargeable batteries in manufacturing motor tricycles (three\u2011 wheelers) powered by electricity and converting motor tricycles powered by petrol or diesel (three - wheelers) into electric powered motor tricycles, the tare weight of such motor tricycles (three - wheelers) increases. Therefore, approval of the Cabinet has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2022\u201108\u201108 to amend the definition in the Motor Traffic Act as the maximum tare weight of a motor tricycles (three - wheelers) as 600 kg, in order to resolve the interpretation issues arising during the registration of such motor tricycles (three-wheelers). However, taking into account the need to introduce a battery system that is capable of covering longer distances on a single charge, the need for a battery system with a higher capacity for air-conditioned luxury motor tricycles (three\u2011wheelers), and the added weight when using electric resistance - operated brakes, local manufacturers engaged in the production and conversion of electric motor tricycles (three-wheelers) have requested the Department of Motor Traffic to revise the definition in such a manner that the tare weight of an electric powered motor tricycle (three-wheeler), including the weight of the battery system shall not exceed 650 kg. Accordingly, taking into consideration the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation, it was decided to grant policy approval of the Cabinet to amend the Motor Traffic Act incorporating the proposed amendment.",
