  "decision_details": "- \"Obata Geyak - Ratata Hetak\" Housing Programme is implemented with the objective of reducing the housing problem and related poverty among poor or low income earners. Under the said programme, a poor or low income family in each Grama Niladhari Division is identified on priority basis and a grant would be provided to construct/improve a house based on the progress of construction. The selected beneficiary should construct a house at least with 550 square feet and in addition to the Rs.650,000/- which is provided by the Government for the same, the balance amount has to be borne by the relevant beneficiary. At the commencement of the programme, the estimated cost of a house was Rs.1,147,000/-, but as of now, the said cost has increased up to Rs.1,764,000/-. Since the selected beneficiaries are not in a position to bear the balance amount in addition to the Government grant as per their economic condition, the proposal made by the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Housing to increase the Government grant of Rs.650,000/- being paid for a housing unit at present up to Rs.1,000,000/-, was approved by the Cabinet.",
