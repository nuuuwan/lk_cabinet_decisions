  "decision_details": "- It has been recognized that state-owned enterprises should be restructured and maintained with good governance with the support of local or foreign investments, without being a continuous burden on the General Treasury and the country's economy.  It is the policy of the new Government to introduce an efficient and transparent mechanism for this purpose. A initial draft titled \"Public Commercial Business Management Bill\" to introduce a new legal framework required to operate state-owned enterprises with effective management and necessary reforms,  has been prepared by now. This will enable state-owned enterprises to be completely free from political influence and to appoint professionally qualified individuals with expertise in the relevant field with professional qualifications to their Board of Directors. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to grant the policy approval of the Cabinet to the said Initial Bill and to appoint a Special Committee with the following composition to submit suitable proposals for further development of the said Initial Bill having reviewed the same, was approved by the Cabinet:\n\n    \u2022 Hon. (Dr.) Anil Jayantha Fernando,\u00a0\n      Minister of Labour and the Deputy Minister of Economic Development - (Chairman)\n      \n    \u2022 Hon.
