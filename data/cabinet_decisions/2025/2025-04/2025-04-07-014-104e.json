  "decision_details": "- The policy of the present Government is to make recruitments for the Public Sector, based solely on qualifications and merits without any political influence. Taking into consideration the rapid increase in the number of unemployed graduates and youths due to the recent economic and political instability and the Covid 19 pandemic, and also the existing fiscal space, approval of Parliament has been granted for the budget proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to allocate a provision of Rs.10 billion from the Budget 2025 to fill 30,000 essential vacancies in the Public Service. An Officials' Committee has been appointed under the Chairmanship of the Secretary to the Prime Minister to re-review the cadre of various institutions in the Public Service and submit recommendations for making essential recruitments. The approval of the Cabinet has been granted for 18,853 new recruitments in the Public Service as of now, based on the recommendations made by the said Committee. Accordingly, the Cabinet, taking into account a proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government, has decided that the relevant Ministries should take measures expeditiously to make the said recruitments by calling for applications in accordance with the prescribed Scheme of Recruitment under the \"Programme to recruit 30,000 unemployed graduates and youths to the Public Service proposed in the Budget 2025\".",
