  "decision_details": "- A Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration is currently established in the Vavuniya District in the Northern Province which includes the largest number of Districts in Sri Lanka. People living in Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu Districts have to spend a considerable period of time in traveling to the Vavuniya Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration to seek the immigration and emigration related services. At the Jaffna District Coordination Committee meeting chaired by the Hon. President, held on 2025\u201101\u201131, it has been proposed to establish a Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration in the Jaffna District as well to provide an expeditious service to the people living in the Northern Province since a large number of them have applied for passports. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs to establish the proposed Jaffna Regional Office of the Department of Immigration and Emigration on the premises of the District Secretariat, Jaffna, in this month, was approved by the Cabinet.",
