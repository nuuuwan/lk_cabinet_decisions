  "decision_details": "- In line with the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2023-2042, the Government\u2019s policy is to meet 70% of the energy requirement from renewable energy by 2030. Accordingly, taking into account the decrease in anticipated electricity demand and the recent rapid increase in the rooftop solar capacity, a ground-mounted solar PV capacity of 152 MW, which could be allocated to 18 grid substations has been identified. The Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Minister of Energy, to reserve the entire grid capacity of 152 MW exclusively for the international competitive bidding process and initiate the process of calling for bids by issuing Requests for Proposals to procure electricity from prospective project developers on Build, Own and Operate basis.",
