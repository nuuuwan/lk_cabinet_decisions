  "decision_details": "- Although, the Intellectual Property Act, No.36 of 2003 provides legal provisions related to copyright, industrial designs, patent rights, brands and business names, etc., there are no provisions for the protection of plant variety rights (pertaining to breeders, researchers and farmers). Further, according to the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act, patent rights cannot be granted for plants and animals. Therefore, approval has been granted to introduce a new Act for the protection of new plant variety rights at the Cabinet meeting held on 2024-05-22. Accordingly, the Legal Draftsman has pointed out that policy approval of the present Cabinet has to be obtained to finalize the preparation of the Bill for the protection of new plant variety rights. The proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to grant the approval of the Cabinet to finalize the said Bill, was approved by the Cabinet.",
