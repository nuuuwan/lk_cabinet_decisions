  "decision_details": "- Since Sri Lanka is an island blessed with water sources and waterways, it is possible to utilize those water sources and waterways for promotion of the tourism industry as well as urban passenger transportation. Therefore, attention has been focused on starting a boat service covering several areas using the country's coastal waters as well as the inland waterways. Accordingly, it is expected to facilitate tourism promotion and passenger transportation by establishing a marine transport service as Puttalam - Fort, Fort - Galle, Galle - Matara, etc. and establish required infrastructure facilities for the purpose. Similarly, it is expected to promote the tourism industry by providing inland water transportation facilities using potentials such as Hamilton Canal, Beira Lake, Diyawanna Oya and Madu Ganga. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism to conduct a feasibility study on the implementation of the relevant project and to implement the proposed project as a Public-Private Partnership programme, based on its outcome, was approved by the Cabinet.",
