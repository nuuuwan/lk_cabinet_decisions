  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka has made a commendable progress in achieving a high rate of school enrollment and quality education. However, the education sector is currently under a severe stress due to the shortage of over 42,000 teachers and growing inequities across rural and undeserved areas. In this backdrop, the need to introduce a systemic transformation in the education sector has arisen. Many countries effectively utilize digital dividend to bring about a revolutionary change in their education systems. Even though Sri Lanka has launched various digital education initiatives, desired outcomes could not be achieved due to their uncoordinated nature. Therefore, it has become essential to implement an unified strategic digital approach which is aligned with the current education reforms. The proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education to establish a Task Force on Digital Transformation of Education chaired by the Secretary to the Prime Minister with the membership of the Secretary to the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education and the Secretary to the Ministry of Digital Economy, comprising of representatives of other relevant parties, to take necessary action for the said purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
