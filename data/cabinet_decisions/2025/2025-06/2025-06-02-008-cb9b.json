  "decision_details": "- The Bandula Pethiya, which was identified in 1991, is a rare and critically endangered fish species endemic to this country. According to current calculations, these fish are thought to number 300 or fewer. It has been identified that this fish lives only within a stretch of approximately 2.5 kilometers of the stream, flowing from Rabbidigala to Hapugoda, in the Galapitamada area of Warakapola Divisional Secretariat Division, Kegalle District. Since there are paddy fields adjacent to the stream that use chemical fertilizers and agrochemicals, it has been observed that living in a stream where high level of human activities are prevalent is a serious threat to the survival of this fish, which is included in the Red Data List. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Environment to declare a sanctuary named the Nikkandupola Sanctuary, covering an identified area approximately 2.5 kilometers of the stream in length and 15 meters on either side of the stream's center line from Rabbidigala to Hapugoda in the Galapitamada area of \u200b\u200bthe Warakapola Divisional Secretariat Division to conserve these limited fish, was approved by the Cabinet.",
