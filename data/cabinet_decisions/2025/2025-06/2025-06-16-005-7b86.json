  "decision_details": "- The watersheds of the Kelani River Basin are currently facing major environmental problems due to severe degradation of the catchment areas, sedimentation in the low-lying regions, sand mining, changing land use patterns, urbanization, industrialization, pollution of catchment areas and deterioration of the water quality. Considering these factors, the necessity of preparing a Watershed Management Plan for the Kelani River, including sub-watershed level management plan with sufficient simplicity and critical details has been identified. There is a possibility of implementing the plan in collaboration with the relevant institutions and the people living in catchment areas to restore the watersheds. Accordingly, taking into account the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation, the Cabinet approved to formulate a Watershed Management Plan for the Kelani River Basin during the years 2025 and 2026, utilizing the provisions of Rs.250 million allocated under the \"Clean Sri Lanka\" program, and implement the same within the medium-term budgetary framework.",
