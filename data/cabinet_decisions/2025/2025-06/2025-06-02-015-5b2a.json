  "decision_details": "- The documents required for the registration of a condominium plan in condominium properties owned by the Government or Government agencies are specified by the Apartment Ownership Act, No.11 of 1973 amended by the Apartment Ownership (Amendment) Acts No.39 of 2003 and No.45 of 1982. In order to overcome the challenges encountered due to the difficulty in completing the said documents, steps have been taken to provide a grace period for registration through an easy and simple procedure through the new Apartment Ownership (Special Provisions) Acts No.4 of 1999, No.27 of 2002 and No.23 of 2018. Accordingly, the validity period of the Condominium Ownership (Special Provisions) Act, No.23 of 2018, which was finally enforced, has expired on 2023-08-14. Therefore, approval in principle has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2025-03-03 to prepare a new Act incorporating the provisions of the said Act. The proposal made by the Minister of Urban Development, Construction and Housing to obtain the policy approval of the present Cabinet to proceed with the preparation of the said Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
