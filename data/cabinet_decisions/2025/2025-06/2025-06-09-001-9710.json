  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet, at its meeting held on 2023\u201111\u201127, granted approval in principle to\u00a0 establish a single Public Company by merging the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. Accordingly, the then State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit has submitted its recommendations on how the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation should be merged to establish a Public Company under the Companies Act. However, action has not yet been pursued in that regard. Nevertheless, it has now been identified that the desired outcomes could not be accrued from merging these institutions due to reasons such as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation using technologies different from each other, the studios of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation requiring more space than those of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, and the difficulty of integration due to their transmission towers being located in different locations. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of\u00a0 Health and Mass Media to continue operations of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation as separate State enterprises with their own distinct identities, by improving operational efficiency and revenue status through a formal strategic business plan, was approved by the Cabinet.",
