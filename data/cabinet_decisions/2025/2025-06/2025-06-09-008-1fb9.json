  "decision_details": "- The Independent Television Network, which was started as the first television channel in the country, operates as a company with 100% share rights owned by the General Treasury. However, due to the fact that programmes have to be produced using computer accessories and outdated software that are several years old, it has become problematic to broadcast high-quality, attractive programmes while competing in the field. Therefore, taking into account a proposal made by the Minister of Health and Mass Media, the Cabinet decided to allocate the required provisions through the 2026 Budget on a priority basis to secure several essential\u00a0 accessories for the Independent Television Network, enabling to enhance subscriber attraction and continue telecasting activities without interruption.",
