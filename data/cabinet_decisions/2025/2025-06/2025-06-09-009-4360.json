  "decision_details": "- Like many developing countries, solid waste management in Sri Lanka is currently facing many challenges and difficulties. Accordingly, the need to improve the infrastructure required for municipal waste management has been identified. The existing garbage compactors and tractors are used to transport the collected municipal waste in an environmental friendly manner to the treatment sites so as to minimize public impact, and 100 compactors were purchased in the year 2017 using domestic funds for the said purpose. However, it has been observed that the number of such vehicles and the number of vehicles including tractors owned by the Local Authorities are not adequate to manage the amount of waste currently generated. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government to purchase 16 waste compactor vehicles to streamline the collection and transportation of waste in the selected Local Authorities, utilizing the budgetary provisions of Rs. 500 million allocated for the year 2025 under the Clean Sri Lanka Programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
