  "decision_details": "- The National Dangerous Drugs Control Board conducts treatment and rehabilitation services for people with drug addiction, under residential and\u00a0 \u00a0 non-residential community-based models. Under this, a dedicated treatment centre for children and young people below 21 years of age with disabilities arising from drug use disorders is being maintained at Mampitiya Watta, Handessa, Peradeniya. It has been identified that separate treatment services and adequate separate space are essential for the treatment of the relevant persons, paying attention to the psycho-social characteristics of the persons belonging to that age group and their drug use related behaviors. Since the current residential capacity of the relevant Centre is only for 35 persons, it is necessary to maintain a waiting list for admissions. Therefore, the\u00a0 proposal made by the Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs to construct a new residential building in the premises of the Peradeniya Treatment Centre, spending Rs.110 million from the provisions allocated under the Clean Sri Lanka Programme, enabling to expand and expedite treatment opportunities for children and young people with drug addiction, was approved by the Cabinet.",
