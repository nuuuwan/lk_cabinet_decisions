  "decision_details": "- According to the mid-year annual population estimate 2024, the elderly community in Sri Lanka is about 2.7 million. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs has predicted that the elderly population of Sri Lanka aged 60 years or above will increase up to 24.8% by the year 2052. Therefore, under the Government National Policy Framework of \"A thriving nation - A beautiful life\", the Government has drawn special attention to providing the necessary infrastructure facilities to live a socially, economically, physically and spiritually satisfying life for the aging adults, enabling to achieve the objective of \"A respectable senior citizen - A meaningful retirement\". For this purpose, the necessity of amending the Protection of the Rights of Elders Act, No.9 of 2000\u00a0 catering to the current needs has been identified. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Rural Development, Social Security and Community Empowerment to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to amend the said Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
