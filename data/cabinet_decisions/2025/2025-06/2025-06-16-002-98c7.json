  "decision_details": "- The Primary objective of the child rehabilitation process is to identify the misbehavior of a child who is convicted before the law and to enable him/her to live as a law-abiding citizen of the society. Accordingly, when taking action against a child who is convicted before the law, mediation, admonition and release, conditional release, probation for child offenders who can be rehabilitated in an open environment, rehabilitation under the Community Corrections Service and detention in detention centres are carried out depending on the nature of the offense. It has been identified that the rehabilitation of such children should be carried out according to an accepted national policy after studying the economic and social background of the children who are convicted before the law and their families. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Women and Child Affairs to draft the \"National Policy for the Rehabilitation of Child Offenders\" with the contribution of the Government, development partners and institutions such as the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF), was approved by the Cabinet.",
