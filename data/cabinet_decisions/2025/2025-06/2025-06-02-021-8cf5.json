  "decision_details": "- African Swine Fever, a highly pathogenic epidemic disease reported in October 2024, first began in the Western Province in Sri Lanka, has now spread to all Provinces. This disease has the potential to raise the mortality rate of animals in an infected farm up to 100%. According to data reported so far, the disease has been reported in 1,594 swine farms and 61,695 pigs have died. Also, the Department of Wildlife Conservation has reported that this disease has infected wild boars in forest areas as well, resulting in the deaths of large numbers of wild boars. Due to the continued spread of the disease, circulation of the pathogenic virus in the environment, and the lack of accurate scientific information regarding disease transmission, restarting swine farms has become a high-risk situation. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land & Irrigation to appoint a Task Force under the Co-Chairmanship of the Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Land & Irrigation and the Senior Additional Secretary to the President (Development Administration) and comprising of representations of other relevant parties, to take necessary measures to restore the Swine Industry, was approved by the Cabinet.",
