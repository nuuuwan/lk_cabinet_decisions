  "decision_details": "- According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka Act, No.34 of 2002, the Authority is entrusted with the responsibility of investigating Aircraft accidents and incidents within the purview of Sri Lanka. However, findings at the Safety Oversight Audit of the International Civil Aviation Organization conducted in the year 2010, have revealed information on the absence of an independent process in the country for conducting investigations on Aircraft accidents and incidents. Accordingly, the Cabinet approval has been granted for the establishment of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau of Sri Lanka as an independent institution in the year 2016 and a Bill had been prepared by the Legal Draftsman for this purpose. The relevant parties have indicated that several further provisions should be introduced for the said Bill. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to prepare the relevant Bill incorporating the said provisions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
