  "decision_details": "- The Faculty of Medicine of the Uva Wellassa University has been established in accordance with a budget proposal for the year 2023. Accordingly, 80 students have been enrolled so far having utilized and modernized the buildings within the university by using the provisions of Rs. 200 million allocated in that year, and the first and second academic years are under way. However, proper functioning of the said Faculty of Medicine has been hindered due to the fact that the necessary lecture halls, administrative buildings and pre-clinical buildings have not yet been constructed. The cost required to construct the pre-clinical building and the essential administrative building, including the lecture halls, within the Uva Wellassa University premises has been calculated as Rs. 2,149 million. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister, in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, to initiate procurement activities within this year and secure\u00a0 relevant facilities by allocating necessary provisions within the budgetary framework\u00a0 2026-2028, was approved by the Cabinet.",
