  "decision_details": "- Approval was granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2023-03-20 to pay the remaining compensation for land plots acquired for Section IV of the Central Expressway Project (Kurunegala - Dambulla) and for which partial compensation had been paid and to divest land plots for which compensation had not been paid in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act. The physical progress of the land acquisition process for Section IV of the Central Expressway Project is 73.2%. It has been identified that completion of\u00a0 Section IV of the\u00a0 Central Expressway is essential to meet the need for a quantitative and qualitative road system to access to the Northern, North Central, Eastern and Central Provinces, and to obtain the expected full benefits of the entire Central Expressway. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to resume the currently suspended land acquisition activities for the future construction work related to the Kurunegala to Dambulla Section of the Central Expressway Project - Section IV, was approved by the Cabinet.",
