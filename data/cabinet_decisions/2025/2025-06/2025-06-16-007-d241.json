  "decision_details": "- Due to various activities such as urbanization, expansion of settlements and establishment of new industries taking place in the lands located near the tanks, there is a tendency for various land use patterns to spread in those areas. Due to changes in land use patterns, it has been identified as a timely need to clearly demarcate the boundaries of the main tanks which are already subject to various impacts and are likely to be subject to such impacts, using official boundary markers of the Department of Irrigation, so that any citizen or party can easily recognize such boundaries. In addition, it has been further identified that it is appropriate to plant suitable trees between the boundaries and form a bio-fence. For this purpose, it is expected that the Survey Department, the Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Department of Forest Conservation, relevant Divisional Secretaries, Farmer Organizations, Environmental Organizations, Social Organizations and school children will be appropriately involved. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation to implement the proposed programme using the provisions of Rs.100 million provided to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation under the \"Clean Sri Lanka\" project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
