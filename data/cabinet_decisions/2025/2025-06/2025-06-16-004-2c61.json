  "decision_details": "- The General Education Modernization (GEM) Project has been operational since 2018 under funds of US$100 million provided by the World Bank. As of now, almost all project components identified under this Project have been implemented and desired outcomes have been achieved. It has been found that there is a possibility of securing an additional financial facility of US$50 million from remaining funds under other projects to implement several other components identified under this project. This additional financial facility is expected to be utilized for improving digital infrastructure in schools, improving sanitation facilities in 900 selected schools across all provinces, implementing reformed curriculum assessment and teacher professional development programmes in relation to the implementation of the new education reforms to be initiated in 2026. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education to conduct negotiations with the World Bank to obtain the proposed additional financing, was approved by the Cabinet.",
