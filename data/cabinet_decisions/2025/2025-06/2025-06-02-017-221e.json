  "decision_details": "- The Commercial Mediation Centre Act, No.44 of 2000, which was specifically prepared to establish a Centre for Commercial Mediation, has not been able to be implemented due to several technical reasons and limitations. Therefore, approval has been granted by the Cabinet on 2022-12-05 to prepare a new Bill with the objectives of repealing the relevant Act, setting out minimum standards for the conduct of commercial mediation and making necessary provisions for the enforcement of mediation settlements through the judicial system subject to the fulfillment of the relevant requirements. The present Cabinet of Ministers also has granted its policy approval in that regard on 2025-02-09. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice and National Integration to publish the Mediation (Civil and Commercial Disputes) Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman in the Government Gazette and thereafter, submit the same for approval of Parliament, was approved by the Cabinet.",
