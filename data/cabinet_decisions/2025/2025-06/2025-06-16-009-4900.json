  "decision_details": "- 119 Diesel-Powered Prime Movers and Terminal Tractors are used for container operations in Terminals of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and for Inter Terminal Container Transportation within the port premises. Out of them, 60 vehicles are over 20 years old and require frequent repairs. Considering this situation, the Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority decided in the year 2023 to purchase 20 terminal tractors, for which prior approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been granted. Subsequently, according to the updated requirements of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority has decided to purchase 20 Electric Prime Movers instead of the previously proposed Diesel-powered Terminal Tractors. Rs. 1,000 million has been allocated under the Capital Budget of the said Authority for the year 2025/2026 for this purpose. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to implement the procurement for the purchase of the said 20 Prime Movers through the International Competitive Bidding Procedure, was approved by the Cabinet.",
