  "decision_details": "- There are about 50 Labour Laws that have been approved by the Legislature since 1923, and the need to update the provisions contained in many of them to suit the current social, economic conditions and the world of work has been identified. Accordingly, the Legal Draftsman has prepared a draft Bill to prepare a single Employment Act by studying 13 existing Acts. The proposal made by the Minister of Labour to appoint a committee representing all relevant parties under the Chairmanship of the Secretary to the Ministry of Labour to further consider the said draft Bill in accordance with the new Government policy and to obtain the views of the employer and employee Trade Unions and identify further amendments to be made, was approved by the Cabinet.",
