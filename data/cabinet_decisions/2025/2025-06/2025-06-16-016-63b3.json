  "decision_details": "- The Universities Act, No.16 of 1978, was last amended by the Universities (Amendment) Act, No.17 of 2016 and it has been observed that the problems arise due to ambiguities in certain provisions of the Act in the selection and appointment of persons to various administrative positions. Accordingly, the need has been identified to amend the qualifications proposed for appointment to the post of Dean of a Faculty under sub-section (1) of section 49 of the said Act and the qualifications for appointment as a Head of Academic Division under sub\u2011section (1) of section 51 of the said Act. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to amend the said Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
