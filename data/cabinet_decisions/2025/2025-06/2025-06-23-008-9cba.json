  "decision_details": "- As approximately 52% of the normal bus fleet and about 94% of the luxury bus fleet of the Sri Lanka Transport Board have exceeded their economic lifespan, there is an urgent need to introduce new buses to the bus fleet of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB). Due to the insufficient number of buses to meet passenger demand on expressways, the Sri Lanka Transport Board currently operates 61 luxury buses owned by the private sector under profit-sharing basis. Sri Lanka Transport Board has decided to purchase 200 super luxury buses for expressways using its own funds. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport, Highways, Ports and Civil Aviation to directly purchase 29 super luxury buses by depots with financial capability, and to purchase the rest of buses by making initial payments using funds of the Sri Lanka Transport Board and paying the balance through monthly installments within a period of 5 years from the income earned, was approved by the Cabinet.",
