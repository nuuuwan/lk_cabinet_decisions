  "decision_details": "- Approval has been granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2024\u201104\u201129 to transfer the Nuwara Eliya Post Office Building to the Urban Development Authority. There were protests from postal employees, civil organizations and the general public against the transfer. It was later decided to implement a project to renovate the said building so that it can be used for the functions of the Postal Department as before and for tourism promotion activities. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Health and Mass Media to revoke the Cabinet decision taken to transfer the Nuwara Eliya Post Office Building and land to the Urban Development Authority and to modernize the said building and land in order to enhance local/foreign tourist attraction and to develop new revenue generation channels, was approved by the Cabinet.",
