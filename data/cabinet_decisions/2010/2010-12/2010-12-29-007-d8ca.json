  "decision_details": "- though Sri Lankan students are being offered Scholarships by various countries, Sri Lanka has not offered any scholarships so far to students of other countries.  As such, it is proposed to grant 100 Scholarships to foreign students to undertake studies in Universities in this country commencing in 2011.  One of the benefits of this Scheme will be to get publicity on the quality of higher education in Sri Lanka, which in turn, would attract more foreign students to our Universities, increasing foreign exchange earnings and such earnings could be used to enhance facilities in our Universities, thereby reducing the burden to the Government.  Cabinet approval in principle was granted for this project.  A policy framework and a composite Action Plan for the purpose will be prepared by the Ministry of Higher Education and submitted to the Cabinet.",
