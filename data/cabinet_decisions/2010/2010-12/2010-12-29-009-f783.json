  "decision_details": "- Public Officers engaged in fraudulent activities in the discharge of their duties are being dealt with in terms of the provisions of the Establishments Code and the entire cost of the disciplinary inquiry is presently being borne by the Government.  This is apart from the legal proceedings, if any, to be conducted in this regard. Cabinet of Ministers considered the recommendation on this matter made by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Establishment Matters after a detailed discussion by the Cabinet Sub-Committee,  to recover at least a certain percentage of the cost incurred on same by the Ministry or Department, in keeping with the provisions of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code, when an accused Public Officer is found guilty at the formal disciplinary inquiry.  Accordingly, Cabinet approval was granted to include provisions in the Establishments Code for the recovery of 25% of the cost of the said inquiry or Rs.30,000/- whichever is less, to be recovered in not more than 24 installments, when an accused Public Officer is found guilty, in addition to other punishments imposed as disciplinary order.  Government is of the view that this measure will, to a certain extent, compel Public Officers to be more cautious and desist from engaging in fraudulent activities in future.",
