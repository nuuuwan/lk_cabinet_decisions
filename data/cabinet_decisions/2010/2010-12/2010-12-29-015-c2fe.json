In this regard, as announced in the 2011 budget, an Urban Development Fund has been established to finance relocation and redevelopment expenditure of new urban townships. Cabinet approval was granted to create a trust to manage the Urban Development Fund and to authorize the Secretary to the Treasury to appoint the Trustees and to execute the related Trust Deed.",
