  "decision_details": "-  Sri Lanka being promoted as a middle income country with per capita GNP of 1969 US Dollars, has achieved significant gains in the area of human development.   The infant mortality rate has declined from 72.4 in 1955 to 10.1 per 1000 live births in 2006.  Similarly, Sri Lanka has successfully achieved a  low level of maternal mortality ratio of 37.4 per 100,000 live births in 2007.  A well established health service, free of cost to the consumer together with universal free education has contributed to bring about this situation.  Cabinet approval in principle was granted to this document  which provides policy and strategic directions for continuing and emerging concerns and challenges in maternal and child health.  An implementation Plan for the purpose will be prepared by the Ministry of Health in consultation with other stake holders.",
