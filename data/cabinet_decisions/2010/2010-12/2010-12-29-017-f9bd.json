  "decision_details": "- the estimated average annual coconut production in the year 2010 is approximately 2750 million nuts of which about 2000 million nuts are used for local consumption and the rest for coconut based industries. Since it was observed that coconut production has declined to a certain extent recently due to several factors, Cabinet approval was granted to take measures expeditiously for the development of the industry, including the supply of fertilizer at the subsidized rate of Rs.1000/- per 50 kg. of  Urea and Muriate of  Potash.",
