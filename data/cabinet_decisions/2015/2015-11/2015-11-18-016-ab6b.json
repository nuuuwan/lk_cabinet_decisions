  "decision_details": "- mplementation of a programme expeditiously with a view to  sustaining peace and reconciliation among various communities living in Sri Lanka and ensuring the Sri Lankan identity in the hearts of all Sri Lankans is a timely need. The mindset of all Sri Lankans should be arranged so as to ensure the Sri Lankan identity as one Nation within the country as well as in the abroad while securing cultural and religious characteristics unique to each community. That will lead the way to build a sound Sri Lankan Nation where the future generations of the country could live peacefully and harmoniously.  Accordingly, the proposal made by the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickramasinghe, to appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee to provide the necessary guidance to implement various programmes, during the year 2016, to ensure Sri Lankan identity, was approved by the Cabinet.",
