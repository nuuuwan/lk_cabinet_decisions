  "decision_details": "- The present population where the Tissamaharama Water Supply Scheme is being implemented is 46,381. The total population benefited presently from the already provided water connections is about 30,500. The people of these areas mainly engaged in agriculture for their livelihood and it appears that the symptoms of the Kidney disease prevail among them.  However, due to the existing shortcomings in the water treatment plant, it has become difficult to prevent the concentration of toxic materials and heavy metals with the drinking water which causes the long term health issues.  Therefore, in order to provide safe and quality drinking water to the people living in the areas of Tissamaharama and Kirinda, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to upgrade the Tissamaharama Water Supply Scheme, at an estimated cost of Rs.393 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
