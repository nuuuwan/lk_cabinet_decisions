  "decision_details": "- Since the Court of Appeal also had upheld a judgment of a District Court that a Donor can revoke a deed of gifts without obtaining a judgment from a Court of Law, certain issues have arisen with regard to the rights of the Donees as some Donors have taken action to revoke the deeds of gifts  unilaterally. Due to this reason, the lending institutions which keep properties received through deeds of gifts as securities have also faced difficulties. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Justice, to draft legislation to make provision to revoke the deeds of gifts only on a order of a competent Court of Law, in accordance with the recommendations of the Law Commission in this regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
