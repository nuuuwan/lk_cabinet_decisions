  "decision_details": "- The Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act, No.59 of 1979 provides for the regulation, control and management of fishing and related activities of foreign boats in Sri Lankan waters.  However, it has become necessary to introduce a new Act to amend the existing provisions, due to significant changes that have taken place in this field internationally and regionally, during the past three decades or so.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development,  to amend the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act, No.59 of 1979, was approved by the Cabinet.",
