  "decision_details": "- Development of transport facilities connecting Polonnaruwa and the other cities situated in close proximity to Polonnaruwa has been identified as a priority under the 'Awakening Polonnaruwa' Development Project. Although there are trains run across the Polonnaruwa District currently, the trains are not popular among general public due to reasons such as taking a long time to travel and inadequate train operations. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to conduct a comprehensive feasibility study for the rehabilitation of the Railway Network from Maho to Batticaloa and from Gal-oya to Trincomalee and for the development of the Railway Stations so as to provide essential facilities with the general public, was approved by the Cabinet.",
