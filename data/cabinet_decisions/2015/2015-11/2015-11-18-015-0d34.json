  "decision_details": "- H.E. the President stated that, in the 19th Amendment introduced to the Constitution in keeping with the Manifesto of \u201cMaithiri Administration - Stable Country\u201d (\u201cMaithri Paalanayak - Sthaawara Ratak\u201d) submitted by him at the Presidential Election 2015, as the common candidate, the powers of the Executive Presidency could not be reduced largely as expected due to the opinion expressed by the Supreme Court that such an amendment requires a Referendum.  Similarly, the proposed amendments for the Electoral System also could not be implemented since the broader consensus could not be reached at the discussions held in that regard. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President, to draft necessary legislation to abolish the Executive Presidency and to revise the Electoral System, taking into consideration the representations of concerned political groups and the public / civil society organizations, was approved by the Cabinet. \n\n\tThe Cabinet also decided to appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of the Hon. Prime Minister, to make recommendations pertaining to the methodology to be followed in the implementation of this proposal and on Constitutional changes that should be carried out.",
