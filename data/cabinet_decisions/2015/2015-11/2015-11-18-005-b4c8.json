  "decision_details": "- The Mahapola Higher Education Scholarship Scheme was commenced in 1981 on a concept of the late Hon. Lalith Athulathmudali.  In parallel to the said Scheme, a Bursary Scheme is also implemented by the Universities, under the Treasury funds, for the students of low income families.  Approximately, 25,000 students are admitted to universities annually and nearly 12,000 of them receive Mahapola Scholarships, while nearly 7,000 students receive bursaries.  Currently, a university student who entitled to Mahapola Scholarship receives an amount of Rs.5,000/- per month and a student who entitled to bursary receives only an amount of Rs.2,500/- per month. Therefore, with a view to removing this anomaly and creating an environment for the students who gain entry into the universities to pursue their studies without financial hardships, the proposal made by Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Minister of Higher Education and Highways, to increase the monthly Bursary payment provided for students, from Rs.2,500/- to Rs. 4,000/-, was approved by the Cabinet.",
