  "decision_details": "- The major challenges the Government had to face when providing school uniform materials with the school children were the timely provision of  such uniform materials to students and the supply of that materials according to the specified standard. The Government also has to incur a considerable cost for packing, storing and transportation of such uniform materials.  Having considered this situation, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to implement a programme for the provision of cash vouchers instead of providing school uniform materials to school children, from the year 2016, enabling them to purchase high quality uniform materials from any shop in the Island, as recommended by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management, was approved by the Cabinet.",
