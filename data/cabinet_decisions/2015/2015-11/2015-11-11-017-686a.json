  "decision_details": "- Most of the people living in the Puttalam District presently depend on ground water sources for their drinking and water related other requirements.  Even in normal dry weather conditions they suffer from acute shortage of water. Further, the ground water in the area also consists of high density and salinity. As a solution to this condition, it has been planned to construct a modern water plant with a capacity of 11,000 cubic meters per day and a water supply distribution network which will provide an uninterrupted supply of safe drinking water to about 81,700 people living in the Divisional Secretariat Divisions of Anamaduwa, Kotawehera, Nawagaththegama, Mahakumbukkaduwela, Mundalama, Galgamuwa, Rasnayakepura and Puttlam.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance to enter into loan agreements separately with the Government of Spain which provides financial assistance to implement this project and the Hatton National Bank of Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
