  "decision_details": "- The Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance requires that all tamed and domesticated elephants of Sri Lanka be registered with the Department of Wildlife Conservation and a license obtained. Under these provisions, in addition to elephants owned by the Department of National Zoological Gardens, a total number of 161 elephants in the custody of private owners have been registered with the Department of Wildlife Conservation.  During the recent past, complaints regarding irregularities and offenses in the method of registration and capturing of wild baby elephants have been received over which investigations have already begun. Representations have also been made in this connection by the members of the Maha Sanga and the Association of Tamed Elephants including various other interested parties.  Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism and Sports Hon. Navin Dissanayake to appoint a Committee to streamline the welfare of tamed elephants in captivity in Sri Lanka and to take appropriate measures in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
