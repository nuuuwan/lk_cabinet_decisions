  "decision_details": "- The objectives of establishing the above Secretariat have, by now, been enlarged into a great extent and as such identifying the new approaches for the socialization of war heroes back into the civil society, promoting the reconciliation among the communities etc; have become a priority.  In order to achieve these objectives, a Research and Development Division with a competent and trained staff has already been established within the Ministry of Defence and as such maintaining a separate Secretariat for Strategic Affairs, which is only an additional financial burden to the Government, is no longer required. Therefore, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripla Sirisena in his capacity as the Minister of Defence for the dissolution of the above office was approved by the Cabinet.",
