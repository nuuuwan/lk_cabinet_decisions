  "decision_details": "- The quality of the patient care services provided by the healthcare institutions of different levels in Sri Lanka differs.  Bypassing of the healthcare institutions close to them by the patients can be avoided through ensuring safety of patients and providing access for an equal and high quality healthcare service to all strata of the community.  This will reduce the rush in the major hospitals, while increasing the utilization of services in the primary level healthcare institutions. Accordingly, the 'National Policy on Healthcare Quality and Patient Safety', presented by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, to ensure the quality of healthcare and safety of patients who attend the government hospitals in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
