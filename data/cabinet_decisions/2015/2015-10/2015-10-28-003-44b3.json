This institute has not been established by a Parliamentary Act in the year 2007, but through a directive made by the then President in terms of the powers vested with him by the Constitution. The proposal made by Hon. Susil Premajayantha, the Minister of Science, Technology and Research, to draft necessary legislation to establish the NRC as a statutory entity through an Act of Parliament, in order to conduct its affairs in a more formal manner, was approved by the Cabinet.",
