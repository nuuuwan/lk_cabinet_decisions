  "decision_details": "- As far as Sri Lanka wastewater management sector is concerned, only 2.4% of the Sri Lankan population is connected to a collective wastewater management system and the vast majority of the population uses individual sanitation systems.  In reality, most of the existing collective systems are out dated and poorly maintained.  This has decreased their efficient functioning. Therefore, under treated wastewater is discharged into drainage channels and this has brought adverse consequences for both the public health and the environment. Considering the prevailing situation, the 'Sanitation and  Hygiene Initiative for Towns' (SHIFT) Project has been initiated to establish three collective wastewater management systems for Negombo, Galle and Kelaniya - Peliyagoda areas.  \r\n\r\n\tUnder first phase of this project, it is expected to establish a wastewater management system for the Negombo Urban Area at a cost of Euro 107 million and the Agence Francaise De Development (AFD) has agreed to provide a financial facility of Euro 76 million for the purpose. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Minister of Policy Planning, Economic Affairs, Child, Youth and Cultural Affairs, to enter into an agreement with AFD of France, for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
