However, the building complex where the Cardiology Unit is housed is very old and the space available in the building is not at all sufficient, in considering the services currently provided by the Unit.  As such, the health staff as well as the patients under go excessive difficulties.  As a remedy, the Cardiology Unit should be extended,  but the prevailing land is inadequate for the purpose.
