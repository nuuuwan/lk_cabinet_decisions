  "decision_details": "- Renal Dialysis & Transplant Unit at Maligawatta provides an invaluable patient care service to the patients coming from all over the country. The Intensive Care Unit and the Isolation Unit of this hospital are also housed in the residential patients' ward.  Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, to renovate the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) expeditiously, with a view to minimize the vulnerability of patients, for infections, through the retention of such patients in the ICU after the surgeries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
