  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka has to incur approximately 30% of its National Export Income, to import fuel required for generation of electricity, every year.  Similarly, it has been revealed through the studies that 25% of the electricity provided to the people goes waste due to inefficient   usage.  Therefore, the  conservation and efficient utilization of energy is very important. Accordingly, the Programme on National Energy Conservation and Efficient Use was introduced.  The proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Power and Energy, to issue instructions to all Government Institutions to promote conservation and efficient utilization of energy getting involving the employees of those institutions with the objective of reducing the energy usage in the Government Institutions by 10%, as an initial step of this programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
