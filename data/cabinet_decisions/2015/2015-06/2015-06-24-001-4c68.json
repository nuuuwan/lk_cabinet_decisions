  "decision_details": "- The medical care received within the first 30 minutes is very important to preserve life, to prevent further injuries and to have a quick recovery, of persons who meet with any accident, disaster or a state of emergency. At present, such an Emergency Ambulance Medical Care Service is being implemented in India, successfully.  The Prime Minister of India, during his recent visit to Sri Lanka, agreed to assist Sri Lanka in the implementation of such an ambulance service equivalent to that prevailing in India, in Sri Lanka as well, with a view to further strengthening the friendship between India and Sri Lanka.  Accordingly, it has been proposed to implement such a non?profit motivated emergency ambulance service, in 04 stages, with the deployment of 297 ambulances and a trained staff of 2,000 members, covering the rural areas of Sri Lanka, further increasing the quality of the free health service.  The proposal made by Hon. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Policy Planning, Economic Affairs, Child, Youth and Cultural Affairs, to implement its first phase through deploying 88 ambulances in the Western and Southern Provinces and to obtain a sum of US$ 08 million to be spent for the purpose, from the Government of India as a grant, was approved by the Cabinet.",
