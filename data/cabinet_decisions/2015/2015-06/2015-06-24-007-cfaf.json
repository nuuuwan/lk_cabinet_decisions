  "decision_details": "- The main cities of Kandy, Galle, Trincomalee and Anuradhapura have been identified for the development under the Strategic Towns Development Programme.  The proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage, to adopt the procedures of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Committees (LARC) and Land Acquisition and Resettlement Special Committees (SUPER LARC) in paying compensation to those who are affected due to land acquisitions for the projects implemented under this programme, which are more advantageous to them, was approved by the Cabinet. This would discourage the initiation of court actions against the land acquisitions.",
