  "decision_details": "- After the Tsunami disaster in the year 2004, the Helmut Kohl Foundation of Germany initiated the construction of a new Maternity Hospital in the vicinity of Galle but discontinued from the year 2008 due to various constraints.  Considering the necessity of the services of this hospital to the people living in the area who were affected by the Tsunami calamity, the proposal made by the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne to award the contact relevant to the completion of the balance work of the project,  to the substantially responsive lowest bidder according to the recommendation of the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), was approved by the Cabinet.",
