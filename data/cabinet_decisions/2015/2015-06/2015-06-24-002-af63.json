  "decision_details": "- Performing their duties in the districts by the District Secretaries/ Government Agents has been obstructed due to the frequent summoning of them to Colombo by various Ministries, for conferences and discussions.  As such, the proposal made by Hon. Joseph Michael Perera, the Minister of Home Affairs, to hold a two day conference in Colombo every month, with a view to limiting the summoning of District Secretaries/Government Agents to Colombo, through providing time/opportunity to all ministries, to discuss matters relevant to their ministries with the District Secretaries/Government Agents during the said conference, was approved by the Cabinet.",
