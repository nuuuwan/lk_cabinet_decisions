  "decision_details": "- The incumbent Government has decided to take prompt actions to regain the European market for fisheries products  of Sri Lanka and the foreign exchange back to the country giving due consideration to the observations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and the European Union, while giving preference to the views of the fisher community regarding the issues in the fisheries sector including the lifting of the ban already imposed on fish exports to the countries in the European Union. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon.Joseph Michael Perera, Minister of Home Affairs and Fisheries, to purchase 1,500 transponders and distribute them among the fishermen free of charge and to complete the process in that regard by August 2015, was approved by the Cabinet.",
