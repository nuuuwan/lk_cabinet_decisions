  "decision_details": "- The Greater Kandy Water Supply Project Phase 1 Stage II is funded by the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) and it is implemented to meet the high demand for pipe borne water in the Greater Kandy Area.  Phase I Stage II of this project includes the construction of a service tank, pumping station, official residences, transmission and distribution lines and road rehabilitation.  Since the newly introduced scope of work of the project has increased the estimated cost thereof, the proposal made by  Mr. Rauff Hakeem, Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage to revise the total cost estimate on the recommendations of the Cost Estimate Examination Committee and the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and also to extend the duration of the project up to 2015?06?20, was approved by the Cabinet.",
