As per the recommendations made by the Committee appointed to review and report the project proposal, and by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs, and taking into consideration the importance of such a project, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, to implement the above project, subject to making changes to the scope of the project as appropriate,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
