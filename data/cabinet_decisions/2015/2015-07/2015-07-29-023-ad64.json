Ranil Wickramasinghe, the Prime Minister, brought to the notice of the Cabinet the situation that has arisen in the CIABOC, as a result of the failure on the part of the Chairman and the Commissioners of the CIABOC, who have been appointed to the said posts by the previous Government, to provide necessary guidance and cooperation to conduct its operations properly.
