  "decision_details": "- De Soyza Hospital for Women situated in Kinsey Road, Colombo functions under the Ministry of Health provides an invaluable service to the pregnant mothers afflicted with complications, who come from various parts of the country. The buildings in which the hospital is housed are very old and inadequate space is a constraint to provide a quality service. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, to entrust the work relating to the completion of the construction of the new Baby Unit which includes the Premature Baby Care Unit expeditiously, with the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, on the design and build basis, at a cost of Rs.325.4 million, where the construction work has now been stopped owing to the negligence of the contractor who had started the construction work ten years ago, was approved by the Cabinet.",
