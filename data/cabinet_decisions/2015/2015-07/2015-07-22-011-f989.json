  "decision_details": "- The North Central Province of Sri Lanka is one of areas where the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) is highly prevalent. According to recent statistics, nearly 2,500 kidney patients are registered in the renal clinic of the General Hospital in Polonnaruwa district, alone. In terms of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in 2015 between the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the People's Republic of China, the Government  of China has agreed to construct a fully equipped hospital complex at the Polonnaruwa General Hospital, to treat kidney diseases, at a cost of of RMB 600 million (approximately Rs.12,840 million).   \n\n\tHowever, since the land space available at the District General Hospital, Polonnaruwa is inadequate for this purpose, the joint proposal submitted by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, to acquire a land adjoining the District Hospital, in extent of 7.27 hectares, presently occupied by the Polonnaruwa Fresh Water Fish Breeding Centre and the District Aquaculture Extension Office, for the purpose of establishing the proposed Nephrology complex and to relocate the Fish Breeding Centre at another suitable place, without decreasing its current facilities and capacity, was approved by the Cabinet.",
