  "decision_details": "- The Department of Agriculture has declared the recommended quantity of fertilizer for each food crop taking into consideration the factors such as  type of crop, soil condition and climatic zones. However, the farmers engaged in commercial farming tend to apply chemical fertilizer in excessive quantities with a view to achieving higher economic gains. Due to reasons such as the usage of chemical fertilizer exceeding the recommended quantity / dosage and applying substandard fertilizer, the healthiness of the agricultural products is under threat and thereby causing adverse affects to the health of the consumers. Although the unmixed fertilizer has to be applied on crops after mixing it with the recommended proportions, the farmers are used to apply fertilizer excessive of the recommended dosages on the crops, for their convenience and also depending on the commercials. Over 100 types of diverse chemical fertilizers manufactured in various countries and with different qualities are now available in the local market and as such the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Agriculture, to take necessary action to declare a standard for such fertilizer with the consent of the fertilizer importers, was approved by the Cabinet.",
