  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka Customs releases about 1,100 import containers per day and  only about 10% to 15% of such containers, randomly selected, are subjected to X-ray scanning by the department owned scanners. These scanners are about 08 years old and undergo frequent repairs. When the Interim Budget-2015, was presented by the Hon. Minister of Finance, it was proposed to establish a Container Scanning System with modern technology, with the view to enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the Sri Lanka Customs. Accordingly, having taken into consideration the  human resources required for the purpose, the cost involved for the equipment and their maintenance, the proposal made by Hon. Ravi Karunanayake, the Minister of Finance, to establish a modern Container Scanning System for the Sri Lanka Customs, with the participation of public and private sectors,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
