  "decision_details": "- A tendency of spreading of non-communicable deceases prevails in the country and a most number of deaths that occur annually in the country due to the affliction of non?communicable deceases.  Both local and foreign scientific researches have proved that resorting to modern farming which depends on the excessive use of agrochemicals neglecting the traditional cultivation methods and deviation from the  traditional food crops and food consumption pattern have contributed to spreading of the non-communicable deceases. On the information furnished by the Minister of Agriculture, Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Cabinet noted that the measures have been taken to purchase 2.5 million kilograms from the traditional local paddy harvest at a rate of Rs.80/- per kilo and a part of which is to be sold as seed paddy among the farmers giving priority to the kidney decease prevalent areas, subject to a maximum of 25 kilograms per individual at a rate of Rs.90/- per kilogram and that the balance to be converted to rice and will be sold in the open market, as a remedial measure for this state of affairs and with the view to familiarizing the people once again with the traditional food consumption pattern.",
