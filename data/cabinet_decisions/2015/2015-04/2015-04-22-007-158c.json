  "decision_details": "- The Transfer of Offenders Act No.5 of 1995 of Sri Lanka provides for a citizen of another country convicted and sentenced to imprisonment by a Court of Sri Lanka to serve his sentence in the country of which he claims to be a citizen.  Likewise, the Act also provides for a Sri Lankan citizen imprisoned in another country to be transferred back to Sri Lanka to serve the balance period of his sentence.  The provisions of this Act apply only when an agreement in this regard has been entered into between Sri Lanka and another country.  Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Hon. Wijayadasa Rajapaksa to enter into the above agreement for the transfer of sentenced persons between Government of Sri Lanka and the Russian Federation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
