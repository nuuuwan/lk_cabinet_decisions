  "decision_details": "- The Western Region including the City of Colombo is emerging as one of the fast growing regions in South Asia and the region is of paramount importance in the economic growth of the country.  The existence of a sound city development strategy is essential for sustainable development. Therefore, it has been proposed to upgrade the status of the Colombo city in the near future to convert it into a regional finance and business hub and a prominent township in South Asia.  It is the responsibility of the Government to guide the development of the Western Region and the Colombo City through a comprehensive, inclusive and dynamic planning process to realize these goals.   Accordingly, the proposal made by the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe in his capacity as the Minister of Policy Planning, Economic Affairs, Child, Youth and Cultural Affairs, to adjust the Western Region Megapolis Plan prepared in 2004 to suit the present conditions and to proceed with the related activities, with a view to expediting the planning process, was approved by the Cabinet.",
