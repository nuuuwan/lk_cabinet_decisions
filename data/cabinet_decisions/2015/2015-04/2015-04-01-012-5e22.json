  "decision_details": "- During the last few years there appeared a tendency to submit unsolicited project proposals by the project proposers for the approval of the Cabinet and the matter was subject to criticisms.  As the cost of unsolicited project proposals is not decided upon, on a competitive basis, the country had to bear an exorbitant expenditure unbearable to the national economy. Having taken stock of this situation, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister,  as the Minister of Policy  Planning, Economic Affairs, Child, Youth and Cultural Affairs to adopt the following measures, was approved by the Cabinet: \r\n\r\n* \tnot to accept unsolicited proposals in future as a matter of policy.\r\n\r\n*  \tto take action with regard to all such proposals in compliance with the Government Procurement Guidelines, in the future.\r\n\r\nto review the proposals under implementation at various stages, and submit each proposal found to have exceptional economic value for the country, for the approval of the Cabinet.",
