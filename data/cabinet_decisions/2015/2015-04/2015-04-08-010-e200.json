  "decision_details": "- Practical tests related to driving licenses issued by the Department of Motor Traffic are conducted on district basis and the practical tests pertinent to Colombo district are conducted at its office premises at Werahera.  Werahera Office receives about 10,000 applications per month for the above practical tests and presently, such practical tests are being done on the main road.  Conducting these practical tests on the main road is a difficult task and other countries of the world practise different developed methods for this purpose.  As such, the construction of a driver training track is identified as a prioritized matter to be implemented expeditiously. The proposal made in this regard by Hon. R.M.Ranjith Maddumabandara, the Minister of Internal Transport, was approved by the Cabinet.",
