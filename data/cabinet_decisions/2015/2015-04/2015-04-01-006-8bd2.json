  "decision_details": "- The Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) was appointed with the mandate to have a flashback of the armed conflict that Sri Lanka experienced and to ensure the dawn of an era where reconciliation is built and issues involved are resolved on the experiences so gained.  The Commission has observed  the instances where \u201cHate Speech\u201d and statements relating to ethnicity and religion have aggravated ethnic and religious tensions in the past four or five decades. The Commission has recommended that tough laws be enacted to deal with such practices and these laws should strictly be enforced. The proposal made by Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe, Minister of Justice, to publish the draft Bill in the Government Gazette as amended by the Legal Draftsman incorporating provisions in the Penal Code to prohibit and punish those who advocate religious and racial hatred and present it in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
