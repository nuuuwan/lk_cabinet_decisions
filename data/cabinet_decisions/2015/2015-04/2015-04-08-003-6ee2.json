  "decision_details": "- Cancer is identified as one of the major diseases reported in Sri Lanka in recent times.  The cancer incidence rate which was 37.6 per 100,000 persons in the year 1985 has been increased to 74.2 per 100,000 persons by the year 2005.  This shows an increasing trend in cancer frequency in Sri Lanka. The  10 most common cancer types in Sri Lanka are the cancers of breast, oral cavity, esophagus, cervix, lungs, thyroid, colon & rectum, lymphoma, ovary and leukemia.  The National Health Policy of Sri Lanka and the Health Master Plan  2007-2016 have recognized the prevention and control of cancer as part of  a broader concept of the Non-Communicable Disease prevention.  Accordingly, the National Policy and  Strategic Framework encompassing all actions to minimize the difficulties faced by the public due to cancer, presented by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
