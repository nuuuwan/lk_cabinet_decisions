  "decision_details": "- Aeronautical Information Management System is used to generate, distribute and receive all the information from the other aeronautical zones, required to control the flights in the Sri Lankan aeronautical information zone. However, it has been apparent that this system is incompatible with the present day needs.  The amount of the aeronautical data to be controlled increases daily and the unavailability of the necessary system assistance has caused in the decline of the quality of the information and the high probability of errors. Therefore, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala De Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to invite international competitive bids for the supply, installation and commissioning of the Aeronautical Information Management System, was approved by the Cabinet.",
