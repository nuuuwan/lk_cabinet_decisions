  "decision_details": "- Although the nominations were accepted in January 2011 for the Election of Pudukudirippu and Maritimepattu Pradeshiya Sabas of Northern Province, the election had to be postponed due to non-completion of the removal of land mines in the relevant areas and the enjoining order issued by the Supreme Court to that effect. There are Public Officers among the candidates who submitted nominations for this Election and they have to remain on no-pay leave due to non holding of the Election.  Since this situation had arisen due to matters beyond the control of that officers, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, to permit the said officers to report to the last served place of work, was approved by the Cabinet.",
