This agreement is proposed as a result of seeking assistance from the Government of Switzerland for the action being taken by the Sri Lankan Government against corruption and financial crimes. By entering into this agreement, the Institute will provide the necessary advice and assistance required in regard to the activities pertaining to the recovery of funds belonging to the Government of Sri Lanka, illegally earned through corruption or other forms of abuse of power. Guidance from this institution will also be available, where necessary, for judicial activities that have to be carried out beyond the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to enter into the relevant agreement, was approved by the Cabinet.",
