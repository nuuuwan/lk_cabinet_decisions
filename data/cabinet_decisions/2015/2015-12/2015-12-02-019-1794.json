  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka, being an Island in the tropics as well as a developing country, intensely faces the adverse effects of climate change. Taking action at national level to minimize such adverse effects of climate change is not sufficient and bilateral and multilateral action, regional agreements or collective action by countries is required to address this matter. Accordingly, the states which face similar kind of climatic impacts and those which had been subject to such impacts have formed the 'Climate Vulnerable Forum' and as such, the proposal made by H.E. the President, Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to obtain the membership of that Forum, was approved by the Cabinet.",
