  "decision_details": "- 50% of the fleet of locomotives in Sri Lanka Railway has already passed the economic life span of 30 years and therefore, in order to provide a reliable and efficient service, the addition of new engines and the gradual disposal of the uneconomical locomotives should take place.  An Officials' Committee appointed for the purpose in the year 2014, has formulated a Procurement Plan for a period of 10 years and as per the recommendation of the said Committee, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation,  to take measures relevant to procurement of 12 Nos. locomotives and 09 units of Diesel Multiple Units to be used for the operations in the Upcountry Line, was approved by the Cabinet.",
