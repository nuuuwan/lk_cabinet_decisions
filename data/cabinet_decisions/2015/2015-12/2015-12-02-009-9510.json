  "decision_details": "- As there are no provisions in the Medical Ordinance to maintain a separate register for the Specialist Medical Practitioners, the specialist qualification is registered, as an additional qualification,  in the same folio where the basic M.B.B.S. qualification of the respective medical practitioner is registered. Other countries of the world maintain separate registers for different specializations and it has been considered as an essential prerequisite to ensure more secure medical treatment for the general public. Considering this aspect, with a view to maintaining the quality of patient care services, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to  take necessary action to amend the Medical Ordinance, in order to the prepare a Specialists' Register for the Medical Specialists, was approved by the Cabinet.",
