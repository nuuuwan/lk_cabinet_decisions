  "decision_details": "- Generally, the many countries in the world frequently utilize the railway for the purpose of transportation of goods.  However, at present, the income generated by the Department of Railways through the transportation of goods is relatively low when it compares with the income generated through the passenger transportation. Therefore, the Department has focused its attention towards non-conventional methods of transportation of goods, with a view to increasing the income generated from the same.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to enter into an agreement, to transport the coal imported to the Trincomalee Harbour by the Holcim (Lanka) Company, to the Railway Station of Maho, from the Railway Station of China Harbour, subject to charging fees based on the operational cost, was approved by the Cabinet.",
