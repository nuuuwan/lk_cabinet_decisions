Therefore, taking into consideration the International standards,  the necessary actions are already being carried out to provide for the establishment of a National Persons Database and issuance of a secured Electronic National Identity Card incorporating the bio-metric information of the relevant person.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Navinne, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, to take necessary steps to enact regulations in that regard, as per the provisions of the Registration of Persons Act, No.32 of 1968, was approved by the Cabinet.",
