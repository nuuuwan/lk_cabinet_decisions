  "decision_details": "- The officers belonging to the Executive Grades of the Public Service, Provincial Public Service and Statutory Corporations should obtain the approval of the Prime Minister, in case they travel abroad for any official purpose, in accordance with the provisions of the Chapter XV of the Establishments Code. The Prime Minister's Office receives a large number of applications daily in this regard and it has been observed that it is not practicable to forward those applications in time for the approval, due to the wide scope of work presently entrusted with the Prime Minister's Office. Therefore, the proposal made by the Prime Minister, Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, to make appropriate amendments to the   Establishments Code introducing a methodology enabling such officers to obtain the approval has to be taken before leaving the country, without delay and easily, was approved by the Cabinet.",
