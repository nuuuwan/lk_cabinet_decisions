  "decision_details": "- The International Labour Organization (ILO) adopted 'the Convention C 122 on the Employment Policy' and its accompanying 'Recommendation R 122' in 1964. The Convention C 122 basically calls upon the ratifying states to declare and pursue an active policy designed to promote full, productive and freely chosen employment, in consultation with the workers' and employers' representatives. 'The National Human Resources and Employment Policy of Sri Lanka' launched in the year 2013 provides the framework for full, productive and freely chosen employment. The ratification of the Convention C 122 will further strengthen the functioning of the labour standard system as well as the social policy of the country. Further, it will be important for the governance as well. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. W.D.J. Seneviratne, the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations, to ratify the ILO Convention C 122 on Employment Policy (1964), was approved by the Cabinet.",
