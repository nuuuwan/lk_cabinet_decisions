  "decision_details": "- although the possession of 34 lands in extent of 271 Acres, 02 Roods and 38.4 Perches owned by the Land Reform Commission has been taken over by the National Housing Development Authority, the ownership had not been transferred over to the National Housing Development Authority and therefore, the residents of the 748 houses constructed by the National Housing Authority on these lands, have not gained the legal ownership of the houses. Therefore, Hon. Sajith Premadasa, Minister of Housing and Samurdhi had submitted a proposal to vest the said lands with the National Housing Development Authority with a view to granting legal ownership to the residents of the houses situated in 34 lands under the 100 Day Programme implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Samurdhi. Since the lands belonging to the Land Reform Commission cannot be vested on a free grant,  in terms of the Land Reforms Law, approval was granted by the Cabinet to vest the lands with the National Housing Development Authority at a most concessionary value after  conducting negotiations with the Land Reform Commission.",
