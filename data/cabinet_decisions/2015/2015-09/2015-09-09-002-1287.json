  "decision_details": "- A vast amount of money from the Government annual expenditure is spent on the purchasing of goods and services required to provide various services to the general public, such as constructions carried out under various development projects, procurement of capital goods and pharmaceuticals, fertilizer subsidies, text books and uniforms for school children. These purchases are done according to the Government Procurement Procedure and it is observed that the government has to face inordinate delays and disadvantages due to some shortcomings found in the procedure. Hence, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, to appoint a Committee comprising of the proficient retired Public Service Officials who possess experience in this field, to submit suitable proposals to make the existing Government Procurement Procedure more efficient and effective, for the utilization of the Government funds more frugally in a manner so as to prevent waste and also to avoid fraud, corruption and irregularities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
