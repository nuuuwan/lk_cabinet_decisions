Accordingly, the Government has planned to implement the Polgahawela, Pothuhera and Alawwa Integrated Water Supply Project and the Kunadasale \u2013 Haragama Water Supply Project at an estimated cost of US$ 280.1 million. The water source of Polgahawela, Pothuhera and Alawwa Integrated Water Supply Project is Ma Oya and the four Divisional Secretariat Divisions of  Polgahawela, Alawwa, Kurunegala (Part) and Weerambugedara will be covered through this project. A distribution network of 380 km will be established, meeting the present water supply demand of 10,000 m\u00b3 per day by providing 50,000 new water connections to 250,000 houses through the  Kunadasale \u2013 Haragama Water Supply Project.
