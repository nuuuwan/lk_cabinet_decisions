  "decision_details": "- Approximately 850 students are studying in the Sri Palee Campus affiliated to the University of Colombo and the unavailability of a suitable playground for students to play and hold sports events is a serious deficiency. Therefore, discussions have been held with the relevant parties to allocate a block of land adjacent to the Sri Palee Campus, in extent of 2.5 acres owned by the Sorana Estate under the Kotagala Plantations PLC, with no crop cultivation up to now, enabling to use the same as a public playground. Consensus of the Board of Directors of the Kotagala Plantations PLC has been received to release the said block of land without compensation and approval of the Secretary to the Treasury as the Golden Shareholder of the said lands has been received pertaining to allocating the same for the said purpose. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in her capacity as the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, to vest a block of land in extent of 2.5 acres from the land owned by the Sorana Estate under the Kotagala Plantations PLC, with the Sri Palee Campus affiliated to the University of Colombo, was approved by the Cabinet.",
