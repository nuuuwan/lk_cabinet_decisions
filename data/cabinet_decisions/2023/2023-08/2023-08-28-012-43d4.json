  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet at its meeting held on 2023\u201102\u201127 has granted approval to procure 50 electric buses as a Public-Private Partnership Project to run on behalf of the Sri Lanka Transport Board covering the Western Province. Nevertheless, it has been identified that it would be more appropriate to increase the number of electric buses deployed under the proposed project up to 200 enabling to provide public transport facilities for a larger number of roads by ensuring the expected benefits of the said Project. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport and Highways to increase the number of electric buses up to 200 to be procured under the proposed project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
