  "decision_details": "- The Term Contract for the supply of 280,000 MT of LPG to Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. is scheduled to expire on 2023\u201112\u201131 and bids have now been invited for the supply of LPG for the period of 2024-2025. However, since the restructuring process of Litro Gas Lanka Ltd. has been commenced now, it has been found that entering into new Agreements may adversely affect the said restructuring process. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to take necessary action to purchase 50% from the total supply of the existing Term Contract from the present supplier as a repeat order as per the provisions of the Government Procurement Guidelines to secure uninterrupted supply of LPG, until the restructuring process is completed after 2023\u201112\u201131, was approved by the Cabinet.",
