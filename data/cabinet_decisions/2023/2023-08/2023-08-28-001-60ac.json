  "decision_details": "- The Wedagama model village has been set up in the Dompe Divisional Secretariat Division in order to appreciate services of Indigenous Medical Practitioners, promote indigenous medicine and enable to obtain the services of Indigenous Medical Practitioners skilled in different areas at the same location. In the said village, 25 Indigenous Medical Practitioners each have been allocated approximately one acre of land, but so far, the Titles of such lands have not been transferred to them. The availability of a freehold deed for these lands in the name of the Secretary, Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine has become a major impediment to transfer the ownership of such lands to Indigenous Medicinal Practitioners. The Attorney General has given instructions on the steps to be taken regarding the transfer of the respective lands to the Indigenous Medicinal Practitioners, and accordingly the proposal made by the Minister of Health to take necessary action to offer formal grants for such lands, was approved by the Cabinet.",
