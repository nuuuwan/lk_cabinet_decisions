The Central Environmental Authority has informed the Ceylon Electricity Board that required permission could be granted to construct the said  33kV Double Circuit Zebra Tower Line along the boarder of the Muturajawela Environment Conservation Area instead of constructing the same in the periphery of Mudiyanse Ela. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to authorize the Minister in charge of the subject of Environment to issue a New Gazette Notification amending the Gazette Notification No.1466/26 dated 2006\u201110\u201113, declaring that construction of a 33kV Double Circuit Zebra Tower Line is a permissible task, enabling to construct the said power line along the proposed alternative route, was approved by the Cabinet.",
