  "decision_details": "- Taking into consideration the fact that a considerable cost is incurred for the Project Offices and Project Management Units established for various purposes and a significant number of staff has been recruited, the Hon. President during his Interim Budget Speech 2022, proposed that the activities related to such Offices and Units have to be reviewed. As such a Committee has been appointed under the Chairmanship of Mr. H.T. Kamal Pathmasiri, a former Ministry Secretary to review whether anticipated objectives of such Project Offices and Project Management Units have been accomplished and whether it is necessary to continue such entities and submit recommendations. The said Committee has recommended that it is appropriate to close down 55 Project Management Units presently in operation, to suspend further 32 Project Management Units and maintain 46 project management units with a minimum staff. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to implement the recommendations stated in the Committee Report, was approved by the Cabinet.",
