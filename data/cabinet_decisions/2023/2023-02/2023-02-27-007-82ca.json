  "decision_details": "- In the face of the international energy crisis, as a measure to minimize the cost incurred for the importation of fossil fuels, it has been found appropriate to introduce buses that can be run on solar power, which is a renewable energy source. Accordingly, taking into consideration the proposal made by the Minister of Transport and Highways on the implementation of a public-private partnership project for the deployment of electric buses for the Sri Lanka Transport Board covering the Western Province, centered on Colombo Commercial City and Gampaha District, Cabinet granted its approval to implement a pilot project based on a formal feasibility study, in the first instance.",
