In keeping with the said decision, a Steering Committee and 09 Working Groups have been appointed to study the matters related to generating electricity using nuclear power. According to the recommendations given by the International Atomic Energy Agency regarding the Self Evaluation Report prepared by the said Working Groups, Sri Lanka has the ability to continue the Project of generating electricity from nuclear power. As such, it has been recognized that being a party to the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage would be appropriate to enable taking necessary measures. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Power and Energy to take future action to become a party to those conventions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
