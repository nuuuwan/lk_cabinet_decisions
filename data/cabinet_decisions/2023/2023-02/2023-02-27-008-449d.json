  "decision_details": "- Jet A-1 fuel used for airplanes is currently supplied by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. Since it has become unable to ensure the supply of Jet A-1 fuel required for cargo and passenger air service, due to disruption of operations of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery, where Jet A-1 fuel is produced and becoming the import of Jet A-1 fuel a challenging task for the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation as a result of the current foreign exchange crisis facing by the country, attention has to be drawn on alternative methods to secure Jet A-1 fuel for the aircrafts that reach airports in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it has been observed appropriate to provide the opportunity for the parties supplying Jet A-1 fuel to airlines in other countries under maximum supply limits, without hindering the supply of Jet A-1 fuel processed at Sapugaskanda Refinery of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy for the provision of market opportunities for the supply of Jet A-1 fuel to the other parties, who are capable of supplying Jet A-1 fuel , was approved by the Cabinet.",
