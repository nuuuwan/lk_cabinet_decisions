  "decision_details": "- Float Plane Operations have been initiated in Sri Lanka in the early 2000 as an attractive venture in view of developing the tourism sector. At present, only one private company is engaged in the said float plane operations and it has been found that another several institutions will come forward to attend to such activities in future. Therefore, the necessity of regulating the float plane operations has arisen in order to ensure the safety of such activities. As such, the Sri Lanka Water Aerodromes Regulations No. 1 of 2022 have been published in the Gazette Extraordinary Notification dated 2022\u201108\u201109 as per the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act No. 14 of 2010, adhering to the obligations of the International Civil Aviation Convention. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation to submit the said Regulations to Parliament, for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
