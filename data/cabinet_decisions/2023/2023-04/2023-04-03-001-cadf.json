  "decision_details": "- Around 3,000 public officers have submitted nominations as candidates for the Local Authorities Elections and they have been granted no pay leave in terms of the provisions of the Establishments Code. However, since the Local Authorities Elections has been currently postponed, those officers have encountered economic difficulties owing to the extension of their no pay leave period. As such, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government for the payment of the basic salary of such officers for the period from 2023\u201103\u201109 to 2023\u201104\u201125, was approved by the Cabinet.",
