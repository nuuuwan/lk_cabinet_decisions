  "decision_details": "- The General public have been facing inconveniences in obtaining the services of Inquirer-into-Sudden Deaths owing to the absence of exact identification of relevant Inquirer-into-Sudden Deaths Divisions since such appointments are made on the Koralaya basis, municipal area basis and hospital basis. Prevalence of large number of vacancies in certain districts due to not granting Inquirer-into-Sudden Deaths appointments for a long period of time also has caused inconveniences to the General Public. With a view to settling such issues and providing a more efficient and regularized service to the General Public, the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms has prepared a Standing Procedure Code clearly stating the provisions including the qualifications for appointment of Inquirer-into-Sudden Deaths, their responsibilities and role. The future programme planned by the Ministry relating to the attachment of all Inquirers-into-sudden Deaths already appointed to Divisional Secretariat Divisions and identified hospitals, appointment of bi-lingual Inquirers-into-Sudden Deaths for bi-lingual Divisional Secretariat Divisions and making fresh recruitments to fill up the remaining vacancies in terms of the provisions of the said Code, was forwarded to the Cabinet by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms and the Cabinet decided to grant the concurrence for the same.",
