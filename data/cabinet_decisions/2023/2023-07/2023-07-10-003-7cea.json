  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka has also now been enlisted in the category of most vulnerable countries  effected by the severe climate change conditions over the last decade. As a result the country has to face unexpected severe droughts and floods due to the gradual decrease in monsoon rainfall in the dry zone areas of the country and the intensified rainfall in the wet zone areas. Optimum management of limited water resources available in this country for drinking, irrigation, energy and service requirements is turning into an extremely complex process under the backdrop of such uncontrollable climate change. Therefore, introduction of more practical Water Resource Policy has become a prime national interest. Accordingly, the Hon. Prime Minister presented the National Water Resources Policy and Management Mechanism of Implementation prepared by the Committee of Experts appointed under the Chairmanship of  Prof. C.M. Madduma Bandara, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Peradeniya, representing the relevant fields, under the coordination of the Prime Minister's Office and the Cabinet decided to grant approval for the same.",
