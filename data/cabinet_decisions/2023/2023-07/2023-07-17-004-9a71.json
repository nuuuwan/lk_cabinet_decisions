It has been proposed to implement a project called \"Promoting Circular Economy in the Food Sector\" using Euro 15 million from that grant.

The project will support the adoption of efficient food distribution channels/mechanisms, to take action to improve food security for vulnerable people by minimizing food wastage, and to convert food waste into farming inputs such as organic fertilizer and animal feed.
