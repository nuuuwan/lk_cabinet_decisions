Under phase 01 of this Project, it is expected to develop a 50 MW Solar Power Plant project with a total investment of US$ 42.5 million and to construct a 220 kV transmission line of 40 km length from Sampur to Kappalthurai at an estimated cost of US$ 23.6 million. This phase is scheduled to be completed in 2 years from 2024 to 2025. In phase 02 of the Project, a Solar Power Plant with an additional capacity of 85 MW will be constructed at a total investment of US$ 72 million. Further, it has been planned to construct a transmission line of 76 km length transmission line with a capacity of 220 KW from Kappalthurai to New Habarana at an estimated cost of US$ 42 million to distribute the electricity generated under phase 02.
