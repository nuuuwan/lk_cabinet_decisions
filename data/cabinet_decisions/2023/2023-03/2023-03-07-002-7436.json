  "decision_details": "- Water is supplied to the Horana Export Processing Zone and the Wagawatta Industrial Zone through a water supply scheme implemented by the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and its production capacity is 3,000 m3 per day.  However, since the daily water demand of investors in Horana and Wagawata zones is about 4,350 m3, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board has prepared plans for the construction of a new water treatment plant with a capacity of 2,000 m3 per day to meet the said water demand. The Board of Directors of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka has agreed to make necessary provisions for that. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Investment Promotion to construct and operate the said new water treatment plant in the Horana Export Processing Zone by utilizing the allocations of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
