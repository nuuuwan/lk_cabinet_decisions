  "decision_details": "- Ridiyagama Rehabilitation Centre located in Ambalanthota which was established under the Department of Social Services in 1975, has been transferred to the Social Affairs Division of the Southern Provincial Council in 1990. Although this centre has been built for the detention of around 450 inmates, currently 576 inmates have been detained there causing them to face a difficult and oppressive living condition. Taking into account the aforesaid situation and the detention of inmates in this centre from different parts of the country based on the Orders given by Courts, it has been found more appropriate that this centre be administering under the Central Government as a national level centre instead of managing the same by the Southern Provincial Council. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment; and the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to transfer the Ridiyagama Rehabilitation Centre to the Department of Social Services, was approved by the Cabinet.",
