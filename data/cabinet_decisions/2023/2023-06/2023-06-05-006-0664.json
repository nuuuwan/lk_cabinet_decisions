  "decision_details": "- Two major reforms with regard to Value Added Tax  have to be introduced as per the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Under this, it is required to revamp the Value Added Tax System by removing majority exemptions and to abolish the SVAT system. It is possible to increase the tax revenue approximately by 1.2% of the Gross Domestic Product  through the re-rationalization of  existing VAT exemptions. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill to amend the relevant provisions in the Value Added Tax Act, enabling to remove the vast majority of  exemptions of VAT by retaining exemptions on the fields of education, health and agriculture and also exemptions which soften the impact on the low-income households and protect key sectors in economy and to abolish the existing  SVAT system with effect from 2024\u201101\u201101 by introducing a more proper mechanism for the refund of VAT, was approved by the Cabinet.",
