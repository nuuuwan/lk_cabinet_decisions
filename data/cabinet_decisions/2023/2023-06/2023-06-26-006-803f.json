  "decision_details": "- Several critical aspects which will affect developing countries facing climate risks, are being discussed during the global climate discussions,, and although more attention was paid to the establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund in the past discussions on climate change, the establishment of the said Fund has been delayed due to various reasons. Therefore, Sri Lanka has proposed that it would be appropriate establishing a 'Climate Justice Forum' with the objective of accelerating the financing of losses and damages and providing an alternative approach deviating from traditional methods. Also, considering the debt crises faced by those countries, Sri Lanka is of the view that it is appropriate to include 'Debt Justice' as an essential component of the overall solution proposal to be given to climate-vulnerable and developing countries for their mitigation and adaptation interventions. Accordingly, the implementation of the strategic programme submitted by the Minister of Environment as the proponent of the idea of establishing the Climate Justice Forum to make the said effort a success, was approved by the Cabinet.",
