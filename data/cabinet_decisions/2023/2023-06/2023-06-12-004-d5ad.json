It has been identified that it is not necessary to implement the said Ordinance further, since there are instances where issues are arisen with the certain provisions of the same when implementing the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No.9 of 2003. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to repeal the said Ordinance, was approved by the Cabinet.",
