  "decision_details": "- The Cabinet at its meeting held on 2022\u201112\u201112 has granted approval to amend the Parliamentary Election Act No. 1 of 1981 to take relevant action in case of violation of the Code of Conduct by political parties/independent groups and candidates contesting for an election and to establish special polling stations for specially identified voters who are unable to vote at the prescribed polling station on the election day. Similarly, Cabinet approval has been granted on 2022\u201112\u201112 also to amend the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, Presidential Elections (Special Provisions) Act, Parliamentary Elections Act and the Provincial Council Elections Act so as to take legal action in case of violation of Media Guidelines when an election has been declared. Accordingly, Legal Draftsman has initiated the drafting amending legislation for the above purpose. However, it has been found the appropriateness of introducing a new Act in the name of Elections (Special Provisions) Act instead of amending the relevant Election Acts separately by incorporating aforementioned amendments. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to introduce a new Act by incorporating the relevant amendments, was approved by the Cabinet.",
