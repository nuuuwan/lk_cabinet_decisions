  "decision_details": "- Since independence, Sri Lanka has experienced a history of civil disturbances, political unrest, communal clashes and a long-drawn armed conflict, during which citizens of all ethnicities, religions, professions and other identities were subject to perils and sufferings innumerable times. Bitter experiences of the past have proved that any form of conflict based on ethnicity, religion, political ideology or other reasons is highly detrimental to the well-being of the citizens and hampers the progress of the nation. However, the trend of such incidents continues thereby endangering the peace and security of citizens and disrupting social and economic systems. The Office of Reparations Act, No.34 of 2018 recognizes the provision of collective reparations in the form of memorials and other infrastructure as the right to redress for communities or groups of aggrieved persons. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to erect a monument in an appropriate location in Colombo as a symbol of healing and reconciliation to commemorate all persons including civilians, members of Tri\u2011forces and the police and ex\u2011combatants who died as a result of armed conflict, political unrest or civil disturbances in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
