  "decision_details": "- Owing to the commencement of development projects/programmes without proper identification and systematic appraisal, it appears that some of the projects implemented during the past have failed to achieve desired results. As such, a proposal for the establishment of a National Development Committee for the methodical appraisal of new development projects/programmes was made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister in charge of the subject of Finance through the Budget Speech for the year 2023. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to appoint a Committee headed by Mr. Daya Liyanage, a former Deputy Secretary to the Treasury in order to submit its recommendations on the projects/programmes with the estimated cost  considered by the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committees or higher than that, to the Cabinet, was approved by the Cabinet.",
