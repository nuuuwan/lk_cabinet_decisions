As a result, the drafting of the South Asia Qualification Reference  Framework to identify competencies in the education sector as well as in the workforce has been initiated in the year 2020 with the involvement of the International Labor Organization. Sri Lanka has participated in the Technical Committee Meetings for that purpose and the concurrence has been granted for the South Asia Qualifications Framework drafted by the Ministries in charge of subject of education in the Member States including Sri Lanka. This South Asia Qualification Reference  Framework does not create any legal obligation for the qualification frameworks of each member country, and serves as a link to the qualification frameworks of other countries in the region. The recommendation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and clearance of the Attorney General have been given pertaining to the enforcement of the South Asian Qualification Reference Framework in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to enforce the  South Asian Qualifications Reference  Framework in Sri Lanka jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment, was approved by the Cabinet.",
