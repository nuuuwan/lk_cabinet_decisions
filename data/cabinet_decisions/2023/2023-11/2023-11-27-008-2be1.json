  "decision_details": "- It has been recognized the appropriateness to amend Act No. 21 of 1969, by which the Institute of Surveying and Mapping was established, enabling to function it as an institution that provides higher education facilities in the field of surveying and mapping. Accordingly, by the proposed amendments, it is expected to create higher education needs in the field of surveying and mapping for students who do not have the opportunity to enter into the university having followed A/L education in the mathematics stream as well as other streams and generate graduates with practical training who can cater to the local as well as and foreign job market. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism and Lands to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill to amend the Institute of Surveying and Mapping Act No.21 of 1969, was approved by the Cabinet.",
