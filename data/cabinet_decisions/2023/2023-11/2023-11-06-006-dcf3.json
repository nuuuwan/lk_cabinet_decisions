Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at the meeting held on 2023\u201105\u201108 to further amend the Notaries (Amendment) Act No.31 of 2022 in order to avoid the uncertain interpretations/complications that have arisen in the said Act and also to simultaneously amend the relevant provisions of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance.
