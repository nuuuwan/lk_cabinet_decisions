  "decision_details": "- Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles and High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) cups and other plastic containers used as other plastic packaging are often used only once and disposed to the environment. The irresponsible practice of disposing such items by consumers and non availability of an efficient waste disposal system have resulted in causing the accumulation of such items to the external environment including the sensitive eco\u2011systems. In order to control the said situation, the Central Environmental Authority has implemented 02 pilot projects to manage plastic waste management in Sri Lanka. Based on the results of the two pilot projects, it has been recognized that the method of refunding the temporary deposit when returning the empty containers, is appropriate. Under the said system, the seller takes a temporary cash deposit when the consumer  buys the relevant product and return the temporary deposit to the consumer when the empty bottle/packaging is returned. In order to further improve this system, it has been recognized that it is appropriate to introduce a QR code system. The proposal made by the Minister of Environment to call for proposals from suitable institutions and implement a QR code based deposit refund system by the selected institution, was approved by the Cabinet.",
