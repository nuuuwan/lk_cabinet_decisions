  "decision_details": "- Under the Maternal and Child Health Programme implemented by the Ministry of Health, 'Thriposha' is provided as a supplementary food for under nourished children aged 06 months to 05 years and as an additional nutrient for pregnant and lactating mothers. However, owing to the stringent cut-off levels for total Aflatoxin specified in the existing Regulations under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980, it has been difficult to obtain the maize required for thriposha production. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Health to apply the cut-off levels of 5 ppb for type B1 which is the level of Alatoxin present in internationally recognized food supplements and the cut-off level of 10 ppb for the total Aflatoxin level, was approved by the Cabinet.",
