  "decision_details": "- Section 5(1) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, No.51 of 1979 states  provisions relating to the appointment of members to the Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. However, required provisions to appoint a representative from the Ministry in charge of Ports to the said Board have not been provided by the same. Since it is more appropriate to have a representation of the Ministry in charge of the subject when making relevant decisions, the proposal made by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation to amend section 5(1) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act , No.51 of 1979 enabling to act accordingly, was approved by the Cabinet.",
