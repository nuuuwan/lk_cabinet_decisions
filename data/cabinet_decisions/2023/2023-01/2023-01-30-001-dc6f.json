  "decision_details": "- The Court in Pelmadulla has been functioning as a Magistrate Court as well as a District Court and currently 8,385 cases are pending before this court. Since, the court house does not have sufficient space, the general public, attorneys-at-law and the court staff have encountered  severe inconveniences. As such, the need to construct a new courts complex equipped with required facilities has been emerged.  It has been found appropriate to have allocated a plot of land of 3 acres from the land called Pelmadulla estate which is governed under the Land Reform Commission, for the purpose. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to get transferred the said land to the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, was approved by the Cabinet.",
