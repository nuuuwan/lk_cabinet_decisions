  "decision_details": "- Currently, the powers to dispose lands under the Mahaweli Development Project have been vested with the Director General of the Authority of Sri Lanka Mahaweli, whereas the powers to dispose lands belonging to the Land Reform Commission have been vested with the said Commission. As the objectives relating to the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Project and the Land Reform Commission have already been accomplished, a suitable arrangement has to be prepared so that all the basic activities relating to the disposal of all State lands, including the disposal of State lands by the said two institutions, could be carried out only by the divisional secretaries. As such, the Cabinet decided to grant its concurrence to appoint a committee under the chairmanship of a Senior Additional Secretary to the President in order to study all the existing rules and regulations relating to the disposal of State lands and formulate a policy related to the disposal of State lands including the new legal amendments to be introduced and prepare and submit the necessary guidelines.",
