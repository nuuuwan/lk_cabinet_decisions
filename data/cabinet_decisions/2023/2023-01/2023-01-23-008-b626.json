  "decision_details": "- Issues of people who have been living for a long period in the forests coming under the purview of the Department of Forest Conservation and the \tDepartment of Wildlife Conservation or those who are engaged in \tagricultural activities in such forests have been discussed for many years, but permanent solutions have not yet been given in that regard. A programme has been prepared with due time frame as per the instructions of the Hon. President with a view to providing expeditious solutions for the said \tissues. Such issues generally affect almost all districts in Sri Lanka and as the initial phase, it is expected to implement the said programme in the heavily \tforested and \twar-torn districts such as Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Anuradapura, Polonnaruwa and Moneragala. Accordingly, the Cabinet concurred with the said programme presented by the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation.",
