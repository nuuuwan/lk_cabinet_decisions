  "decision_details": "- Due to the lack of legal provisions on management and disposal of court productions, certain materials that need to be disposed of quickly have to be retained causing economic loss and also issues have arisen due to becoming such items unusable. Therefore, a committee has been appointed to recommend a new policy and legal framework including relevant legal provisions and procedures to dispose the court productions before the end of trial. Based on the recommendations of the said committee, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to enact an Act to manage and dispose of Court Productions and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill for that purpose, was granted approval by the Cabinet.",
