  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at the Meeting held on 2023\u201101\u201109 to enter into a Record of Discussion between the Korea Tourism Organization and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority for the implementation of a pilot project related to the implementation of a community-based tourism development project focusing on the Central, Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka under a grant of 2.172 billion Korean Won.  Although, it had been planned to implement the entire project based on the success of the pilot project, after its implementation, the representatives of the Korea Tourism Organization after visiting the relevant provinces have agreed to implement the entire project as scheduled instead of a pilot project. Accordingly, the Cabinet having considered the matters submitted by the Minister of Tourism and Lands on the measures taken to enter into a revised Agreement between two parties enabling to implement the project, decided to grant the concurrence of the Cabinet to pursue action accordingly.",
