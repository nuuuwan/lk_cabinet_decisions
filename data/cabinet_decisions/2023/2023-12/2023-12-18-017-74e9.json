Accordingly, Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation Limited has imported 155 million eggs at present and necessary steps have been taken to import another 18 million eggs before 2023\u201112\u201131. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security to further import eggs from Indian farms which have already been recommended by the Department of Animal Production and Health, since there is a trend of increasing the retail price of eggs in the domestic open market at present, was approved by the Cabinet.",
