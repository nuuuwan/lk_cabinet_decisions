  "decision_details": "- Although the Cabinet approval has been granted at its meeting held on \t2022\u201109\u201122 to enter into the Treaty on mutual legal assistance in criminal \tmatters between the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Republic \tof Maldives, the said Treaty was not signed due to suggesting few amendments \tsubsequently \tfor the proposed Treaty by the Maldives party. Thereafter, a new \tamended draft has been prepared upon the concurrence of both parties and the \tclearance of the Attorney General has been received for the that. Accordingly, the \tproposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional \tReforms to sign the \tsaid Treaty and thereafter ratify the same by Diplomatic \tMissions of both countries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
