  "decision_details": "- Mr. Edward Henry Pedris who was 27 years at the time, has been brought before a Court Martial on charges of inciting riots and treason against the Government by the colonial administration of Sri Lanka and convicted of treason and executed on 1915\u201107\u201107 without considering any appeal. The body of the late Mr. Henry Pedris has been cremated in an undisclosed premise following the procedure prescribed for the cremation of a convicted criminal under the Martial Law. His assassination has been later identified as a result of a plan carried out by the senior officers who administered the country at that time. Accordingly, the Cabinet approved the proposal made by the Hon. President to appoint a committee comprising of three members which is chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Mr. Anil Goonaratne, to disclose actual information related to the said execution, study relevant information and submit a Report with recommendations to the Cabinet in order to bring justice to him.",
