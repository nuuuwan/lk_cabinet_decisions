  "decision_details": "- Overcrowding in prisons in Sri Lanka has been identified as a long-standing problem. As a remedy to that problem, a Committee headed by a Judge of the Supreme Court has been appointed to make suitable recommendations to introduce legal provisions to detain in appropriate cases suspects and convicts under House Arrest as an alternative to remand/imprisonment. The proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to introduce appropriate laws, based on the Report submitted by the said Official's Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
