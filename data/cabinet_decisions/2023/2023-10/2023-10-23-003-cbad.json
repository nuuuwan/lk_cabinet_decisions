  "decision_details": "- The Peace Corps programmes supported by the United States Congress have been implemented in Sri Lanka during the periods from 1962 - 1964, 1983 - 1998 and 2004 - 2006. According to a memorandum of understanding signed between the Ministry of Education and the Peace Corps in 2018, a consensus has been reached between the two parties to implement a programme to improve English language education in Sri Lanka by providing volunteers for a period of five (05) years. However, due to the Easter Sunday attack and the Covid\u201119 pandemic situation, Peace Corps has not been able to implement the programme as scheduled. Since the Peace Corps has now agreed to re-implement the said programme in Sri Lanka, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to extend the MoU signed between the two parties for a further period of 05 years with effect from August 2023, was approved by the Cabinet.",
