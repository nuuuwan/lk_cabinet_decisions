  "decision_details": "- Generation of solar power energy on the surface of reservoirs through the construction of floating solar power plants deemed as a better alternative for land limited countries. Accordingly, it has been identified that there is a good potential on the surface of the reservoirs that are under the purview of Ceylon Electricity Board and the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, to implement solar energy generation projects and have confirmed that there is a possibility of utilizing approximately 100 Hectares of the water surface of Samanala Wewa Reservoir under Ceylon Electricity Board for the construction of a floating solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant of 150-200 MW.  Accordingly,  the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to call requests for proposals from the interested proponents to construct and implement the proposed solar power plant adhering to National Procurement Guidelines applicable for the implementation of infrastructure projects, was approved by the Cabinet.",
