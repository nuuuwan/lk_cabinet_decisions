  "decision_details": "- Steps had been taken to amend the Powers of Attorney Ordinance by the Act, No.28 of 2022, with the objective of preventing fraudulent activities committed by the Power of Attorney holders relating to lands. Subsequent to the enforcement of the said amendments, several legal complications have arisen especially on the foreign Powers of Attorney, cancellation and revocation of Powers of Attorney and the time period given to register a Power of Attorney prepared before the enforcement of the respective amendments.  Therefore, the approval was granted at the Cabinet meeting held on 2023\u201105\u201108 to prepare a Bill to further amend the Powers of Attorney Ordinance. The Powers of Attorney (Amendment) Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman as per the said approval,  has received the clearance of the Attorney General. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter, submit it to Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
