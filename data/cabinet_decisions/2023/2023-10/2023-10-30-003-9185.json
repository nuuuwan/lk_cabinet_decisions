  "decision_details": "- According to the Constitution, the Government of Sri Lanka is obliged to 'assure all persons' right to universal and equal access to education at all levels to eradicate the illiteracy'. Since providing all the facilities by the Government for the said task is practically difficult, the support of the other parties is also obtained for that. Accordingly, since the year 2005, the Ministry of Education has been implementing the Reading Development Programme and Girls' Education Programme together with the Room to Read organization. As of now, it has been planned to further expand the said programme and implement within a period of five (05) years to be effective from 2023\u201112\u201101, and for that purpose, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to enter into a new Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Education and the Room to Read organization, was approved by the Cabinet.",
