  "decision_details": "- Ensuring accountability, credibility, clarity and professionalism of Members of Parliament are essential factors in enhancing the public trust in the efficacy, transparency and equity of the legislature. Therefore, Members of Parliament should, at all times, exercise their powers, privileges, functions and duties with probity and integrity. Taking into consideration that there is a mechanism for the implementation of a Code of Conduct for the Members of Parliament in most countries in the world and and for monitoring such activities, It has been identified the necessity of establishing an independent institution for preparing a Code of Conduct for the Members of Parliament in this country as well and for monitoring the same. Accordingly, the proposal jointly submitted by the Hon. Prime Minister and the Minster of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to obtain the views of the Speaker of Parliament and all Party Leaders on the initial draft prepared for the above purpose and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to formulate a Bill taking also into account the said views, was approved by the Cabinet.",
