  "decision_details": "- Even though the Rent Act, No.7 of 1972 which was introduced with the objective of determining the rights and the duties of landlords and tenants, was amended at several occasions, it is observed that the intended objectives of the Act are not being met. The Advisory Committee on Rent Law set up under the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms has examined the matters with this regard and has proposed that it would be appropriate to introduce a new law with the aim of safeguarding the rights of the landlord and the tenant equally. Taking\tthese proposals into consideration, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to repeal the Rent Act, No.7 of 1972 and to introduce a fresh Act namely, the Protection of Occupants Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
