  "decision_details": "- A program has been designed to provide opportunities for the students who complete G.E.C. (O/L) until they start studies for G.E.C. (A/L) or those who complete the G.E.C. (A/L) examination until they embark upon vocational Education, to complete a curriculum that covers five basic areas related to vocational education while retaining them within the school system. The program is mainly expected to develop Information Technology and English language which are generally important for professional education and also develop soft skills in parallel with the same.
