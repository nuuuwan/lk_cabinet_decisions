  "decision_details": "- With the objective of ensuring that the well-being of disabled children in the society is  prioritized and they receive comprehensive care, it has been proposed that it is appropriate to make amendments to the Inland Revenue Act so that any charitable organization established as a legal entity or registered under any law enforced for the registration of social service organizations that provides health facilities to children in collaboration with Government health care/education system can claim tax relief. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Acting Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to amend the Inland Revenue Act by incorporating the necessary legal provisions for that purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
