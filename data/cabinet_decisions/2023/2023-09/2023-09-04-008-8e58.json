  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that in the production of electric-powered motor tricycles and in the conversion of motor tricycles powered by petrol or diesel into electric motor tricycles, the tare weight of such tricycles may exceed 500 kilograms since electric-charged batteries are used for that. Also, according to the interpretation of the Motor Traffic Act, the tare weight of a motor tricycle must not exceed 500kg and the gross weight must not exceed 1000kg. Accordingly, the Cabinet at its meeting held on 2022\u201108\u201108 has granted approval to amend the Motor Traffic Act by removing prevailing impediments to register electric-powered tricycles. Clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman as per the said approval. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport and Highways to publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and submit the same thereafter, to Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
