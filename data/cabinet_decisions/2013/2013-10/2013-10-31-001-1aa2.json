  "decision_details": "- it has been observed that the country has entered a phase of rapid growth and development and that the workforce has to be transformed into a productive human resource which is physically and mentally fit to meet the challenges.  The improvement of nutrition of all age groups and segments of the population up to the required level needs intervention not only from the health sector but also from stakeholders from other sectors such as education, agriculture, livestock etc.  Nutrition is thus identified as requiring a multi-sectoral approach.  The Multi-Sector Action Plan for nutrition comprises activities formulated by a panel of experts under the guidance of the National Nutrition Council (NNC) in keeping with globally accepted standards for nutrition.  The proposal made by H.E. the President in his capacity as the Chairman, National Nutrition Council, to proceed with the activities relating to the above, was approved by the Cabinet.",
