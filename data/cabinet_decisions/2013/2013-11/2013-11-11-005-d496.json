  "decision_details": "\u2013 the Government has observed that it has become a timely need to draft a new Bill to deal with all aspects in the field of seeds and planting material in keeping with the new trends of scientific agricultural development in the country.  The use of low quality seeds has led to various issues including low productivity and farmer disputes.  The provisions presently available under the Seed Act, No. 22 of 2003 are insufficient to address such issues and to ensure the rights of farmers.  Accordingly, it was decided to refer the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Minister of Agriculture, to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Legislation for its recommendations.",
