  "decision_details": "- children between the age group 5-12 years from all parts of the country visit the Lady Ridgeway Childrens? Hospital for medical treatment and some of them are warded in the hospital for several months for treatment purposes and due to their long stay in the hospital they lose school days for a considerable period.  To overcome this situation, the proposal made by Hon. Bandula Gunawardena, Minister of Education, to attach 5 Diploma holders of the National Colleges of Education (04 Sinhala medium and 01 Tamil medium) who join the Teachers' Service, to engage such student patients in educational activities by visiting the hospital, was approved by the Cabinet.",
