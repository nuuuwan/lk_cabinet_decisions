The Conference is convened to mark this years' UN declared theme 'International Year of Water Co-operation'.  The objective of this Conference is to provide a platform for sharing knowledge, strategies and best practices and to promote dialogue, mutual understanding and co-operation among communities managing their water schemes.  Sri Lanka has over 15 years of experience in promoting community organizations to provide their own water supply for drinking and sanitation facilities through community water supply and sanitation projects. Over 3500 community based organizations that were formed to implement the projects are now empowered to manage, operate and maintain these systems with the support of the National Community Water Trust (NCWT) and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.  About 500 delegates from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Afghanistan and Maldives are expected to participate at the Conference.   The proposal made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, to proceed with the relevant activities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
