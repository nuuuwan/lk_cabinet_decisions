  "decision_details": "- Next Generation Networks (NGNs) carry all types of services, including voice, video and e-mail, on a common platform.\u00a0 This 'network convergence' allows operators to save money by having to maintain only one network platform and to provide new services that combine different types of data.\u00a0 NGNs are more versatile than traditional networks because they do not have to be physically upgraded to support new types of services.\u00a0 The proposal made by H.E. the President, to adopt the Policy and Regulatory Framework for Next Generation Networks in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
