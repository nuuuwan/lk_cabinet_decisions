  "decision_details": "- Since fuel is essential for all the economic activities of the country, it has been found appropriate to issue licenses to selected special industries to import fuel required for their businesses individually. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Energy to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to amend the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Act No.33 of 2002, so that parties formally identified could be granted licenses to import petroleum, was approved by the Cabinet.",
