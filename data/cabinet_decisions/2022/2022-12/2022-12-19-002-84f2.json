  "decision_details": "- Although Monaragala District is geographically the second largest district, no office of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment or a training Centre is operated within the district. The closest training centres to the said district are located at Haliela in Badulla District, Tangalla in Hambanthota district and Ampara. It is possible to use the training Centre located in Bibile road, Monaragala which is presently under the custody of the Department of Divineguma to set up a district training centre of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment thereby providing required training facilities for those who seek foreign employment in low-income earning families. As such the joint proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment; and the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment to hand over the training Centre and premises located in Bibile road, Monaragala to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, was approved by the Cabinet.",
