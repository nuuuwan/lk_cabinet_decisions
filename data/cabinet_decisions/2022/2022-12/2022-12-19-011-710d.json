  "decision_details": "- Upcountry Tamils who migrated to Sri Lanka from India around 200 years ago, live in Central, Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces and they contribute to the national economy in various ways. Their contribution is around 1/3 of the total income of the plantation sector. Accordingly, the Cabinet concurred with the proposal made by the Hon. President to implement the programmes identified with a view to upgrading the living standards of Upcountry Tamil community in collaboration with the Ministry of Plantation Industries and other relevant State institutions to commemorate the completion of 200 years since the arrival of the first generation of the Upcountry Tamil Community to Sri Lanka by February 2023.",
