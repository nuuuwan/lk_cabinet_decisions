  "decision_details": "- The Australian Volunteers Programme funded by the Government of Australia is being implemented across 26 countries and grants are provided under the said programme to make change through locally-led work and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. A Memorandum of Understanding has been entered into between Australia and Sri Lanka in the year 2017 in order to implement the said programme in Sri Lanka and the time period of the said MoU has expired by now. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to sign a Memorandum of Subsidiary Arrangement (MSA) to implement the said programme for another period of five years in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
