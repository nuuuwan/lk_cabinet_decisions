  "decision_details": "- In terms of the Article 104B(5)(a) of the 1978 Constitution, Media Guidelines have been published by the Election Commission under the Gazette Extraordinary Notification No.2178/24 dated 2020\u201106\u201103. Nevertheless, provisions pertaining to action that could be taken in the event of violating such guidelines have not been enacted yet. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President to instruct the Legal Draftsman to include the provisions which indicate that the violation of media guidelines is an election offence in the Presidential Elections (Special Provisions) Act, the Parliamentary Election Act, Local Authorities Elections Ordinance and the Provincial Councils Elections Act or to draft a Bill incorporating relevant provisions enabling take action treating the violation of media guidelines as an offence under each Act related to elections, was approved by the Cabinet.",
