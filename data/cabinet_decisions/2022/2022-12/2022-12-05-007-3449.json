  "decision_details": "- Although, the Commercial Mediation Center of Sri Lanka Act No.44 of 2000 was passed by Parliament for the establishment of a Commercial Mediation Center, the anticipated functions could not be fulfilled through the said Act due to the various technical reasons and certain limitations. At present, most of countries adopt voluntary mediation to settle disputes and most of such countries have taken action to introduce rules and regulations for voluntary mediation. Further, such countries have made necessary legislation to authorize their Courts to take action against the parties for an unreasonable refusal to voluntary mediation. It has been found necessary to introduce new legislation to the legal system of this country to encourage towards voluntary mediation giving due attention to the said international tendency. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to take necessary action to prepare the Mediation (Settlement of Civil and Commercial Disputes) Bill in order to repeal the Commercial Mediation Center of Sri Lanka Act No. 44 of 2000 and make provisions for legal provisions on voluntary mediation for civil and commercial disputes and incidental maters related thereto, was approved by the Cabinet.",
