  "decision_details": "- Committing sexual harassment violates the fundamental human rights and freedom and provisions related thereto are included in section 345 of the Penal Code. It is observed that this problem continues to exist even though the law provides for the imposition of punishment for such crimes. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a draft Bill enabling to amend the Penal Code by incorporating sections which make sexual harassment and all forms of sexual assaults as criminal acts and provide stringent punishment therefor and include a new section to make sexual bribery an offence, was approved by the Cabinet.",
