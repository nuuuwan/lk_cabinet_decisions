  "decision_details": "- A female Sub-Postmaster is entitled to obtain maternity leave as per the provisions of the Establishments Code, subject to employing a substitute in service at her own expense during her maternity leave period in terms of the Service Minute of the Sri Lanka Sub-Postmaster Service and an allowance equivalent only to 30 day daily wage is paid as the substitute allowance during that period. It is observed that most of the female Sub - Postmasters limit their maternity leave only up to 30 days due to the fact that a substitute has to be employed at her own expense during the relevant maternity leave period. According to the recommendations of the World Health Organization and other medical recommendations, breast milk should be provided to infants at least up to six months from their birth. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Mass Media to pay 84 days allowance instead of the 30 days allowance being paid to female Sub-Postmasters, was approved by the Cabinet.",
