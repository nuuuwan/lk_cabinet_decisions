  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2022\u201103\u201114 for the payment of an amount of Rs.100,000/- to the next of kin of the missing person, based on the Certificate of Absence issued for the families of missing persons by the Registrar General. However, taking into consideration the matters that it takes a long time to obtain the Certificate of Absence and the amount of Rs.100,000/- being paid is not sufficient, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to dispense with the requirement of obtaining the Certificate of Absence, if the Office for Reparations has confirmed that the person concerned has been missing and increase the allowance being paid up to Rs.200,000/-, was approved by the Cabinet.",
