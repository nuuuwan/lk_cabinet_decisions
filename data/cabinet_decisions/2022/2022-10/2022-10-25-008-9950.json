  "decision_details": "- Solar Rooftop has added 580MW to the national grid at present and it has been identified the necessity of obtaining another 1800MW through that as per the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan prepared by the Ceylon Electricity Board. As an incentive for that, a Committee has been appointed to submit recommendations for revising the tariff applicable for the purchase of electricity from the presently approved solar power plants. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Power and Energy to revise the tariff as per the recommendation of the said Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
