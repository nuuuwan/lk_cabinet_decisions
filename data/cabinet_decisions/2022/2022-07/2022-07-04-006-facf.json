  "decision_details": "- The Board of Directors of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank consists of non\u2011resident Directors and they represent 12 Constituencies comprising one or more member countries. Sri Lanka as a founding member of the said Bank represents its 11th Constituency. Indonesia is the major shareholder of that constituency. Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and Timor-Leste are the other  member countries. According to the Memorandum of Understanding signed among those Constituency members in the year 2016, the Director and the Alternate Director positions relating to that Constituency are exchanged according to a rotation scheme. Accordingly, Sri Lanka has got the opportunity to lead that constituency and hold the Director position during the period of 2022 - 2024 and a Deputy Secretary to the Treasury has been nominated for the same. It is more important for Sri Lanka to get that position in this instance and it is required to provide necessary facilities for the Board level tasks since that Board of Directors functions as a non-resident Board. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to establish a Constituency Office of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank under the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, was approved by the Cabinet.",
