  "decision_details": "- The monopoly for import/storage and distribution of Ammonium Nitrate explosives used for Cement/Water gel/Emulsion manufacturing industries and granite blasting industries has been vested with Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation Ltd. There is a shortage of Ammonium Nitrate explosives in the country due to the current foreign exchange deficit in the country and inability of suppliers who supplied the said explosives to  Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation Ltd for a long period to supply the same. This has severely affected to the activities of industries using the said explosives. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E the President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence to take necessary action expeditiously to import Ammonium Nitrate explosives to the country with the intervention of the Ministry of Defence for short period as a solution to the above issue, was approved by the Cabinet.",
