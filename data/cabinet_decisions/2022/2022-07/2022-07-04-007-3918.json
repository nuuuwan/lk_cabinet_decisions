  "decision_details": "- Although the Sri Lanka Air Force and the Road Development Authority have developed the Batticaloa Airport as a domestic flight destination in the year 2018, the said Airport does not generate any income since it has been exempted from the landing and parking charges. Taking into consideration this situation, it has been found that it would be appropriate to use the space of the said Airport for any other productive purpose. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation to invite Requests for Proposals to establish a Flight Training Institute at that Airport, was approved by the Cabinet.",
