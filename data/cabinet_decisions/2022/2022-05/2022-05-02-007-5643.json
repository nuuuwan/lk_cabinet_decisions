  "decision_details": "- Since the low income families receiving Samurdhi, elder, kidney and disable allowances have been severely affected due to the prevailing economic crisis in the country, the Government has identified the necessity of providing concessions expeditiously for such families and those who are in waiting lists to receive such allowances. Concurrence has been granted to provide necessary provisions for the same through the Contingent Emergency Response Components of Projects implemented under the World Bank funds. Accordingly, the proposals made by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Samurdhi Development to take necessary action to pay a special cash allowance in order to provide the relevant concessions for the identified beneficiary families from May to July, were approved by the Cabinet.",
