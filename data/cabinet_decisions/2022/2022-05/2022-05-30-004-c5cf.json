  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2021\u201103\u201108 to amend the Termination of Employment of workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No.45 of 1971 and The Industrial Disputes Act, No.43 of 1950 so that relevant provisions could be imposed to the effect that a security could be furnished in case where appeals, revisions and writ applications can be filled against the awards and decrees granted under those Acts. Accordingly, the clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the bills drafted by the Legal Draftsman. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment to publish the said bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter submit the same in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
