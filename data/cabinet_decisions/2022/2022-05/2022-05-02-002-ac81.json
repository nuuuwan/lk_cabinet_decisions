  "decision_details": "- Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited (AASL) has planned to implement several multi-dimensional improvements to enhance the efficiency of the operations of the Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake. Accordingly, a proposal has been made to implement a pilot project for introduction of a digital channel for the passengers departing from Terminal-1, based on the concept \u201cIATA One ID\u201d of the International Air Transport Association. As such, by installing e-gates/Face pods at the entrance to the departure terminal and verifying that they are with possession of a valid e-ticket to confirm their identity, it will be convenient to complete the check-in process of the passengers. Therefore, the Cabinet decided to grant its approval to implement a pilot project for the purpose as proposed by the Minister of Tourism.",
