  "decision_details": "- International civil aviation limits of liability adopted under the Montreal Convention for the International Carriage by Air, was declared by the Gazette Notification dated 2021\u201101\u201122 and the high limits of liability stated therein, seem to have been appeared a hindrance for the development of the Aviation Industry of Sri Lanka. As such, a committee has been appointed to review the relevant limits of liability of the Carriage by Air Act, No.29 of 2018 so as to be able to consider exemption of the Aviation industry from such limits of liability. The said Committee has recommended that it would be appropriate to introduce amendments to the sections 2, 5 and 8 of the  Carriage by Air Act, No.29 of 2018. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation to take necessary action to amend the relevant sections of the said Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
