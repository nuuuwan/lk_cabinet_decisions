  "decision_details": "- Although, there is an increased tendancy for the Government Institutions to work on digital systems, the information and information technology systems of such organizations are at a severe risk, owing to the inadequate attention payed on information and cyber security, use of obsolete technologies and the shortage of skilled carder to manage cyber security in the Public Sector. In order to control the said situation, the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team has drafted the Information and Cyber Security Policy for Government Institutions, adhering to the Information and Cyber Security Strategy 2019-2023 and in compliance with the recognized international information security standards. It is compulsory to implement this policy by all Government institutions defined as \u201cPublic Authorities\u201d in the Right to Information Act, No. 12 of 2016. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Technology, to implement the proposed Information and Cyber Security Policy  for the Government institutions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
