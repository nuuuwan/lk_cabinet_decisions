  "decision_details": "- Nawalapitiya Al-Safa Primary School has been built in the year 2013 under the 1000 secondary school re-establishment programme and the building space required for that have been fulfilled by a warehouse belonging to the Nawalapitiya Railway Station. It has been identified the necessity of constructing permanent buildings since the space available in the said building is not adequate with the increase of number of students.
