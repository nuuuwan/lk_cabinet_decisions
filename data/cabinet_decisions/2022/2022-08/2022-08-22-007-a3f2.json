  "decision_details": "- The National Colleges of Education provide teacher training as two year  institutional training and one year internship for those who have passed the G.C.E A/L examination. The National Colleges of Education will not provide hostel facilities during the internship and trainees have to bear the accommodation and traveling expenses themselves. The sum of Rs 5000 which is currently being paid to a teacher trainee during their institutional training is not adequate. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Education to take necessary action enabling teacher trainees to obtain a financial provision of maximum of Rs 10,000 per month under a concessionary interest basis through a State bank in addition to the allowance being paid to  them at present, was approved by the Cabinet.",
