  "decision_details": "- Owing to the fact that the existing scarcity of fuel has resulted in causing a problem for the public servants to secure their transport facilities and also as a remedy for the forthcoming food crisis, approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2022\u201106\u201113 to close down the Government Offices on Fridays for the purpose of facilitating the government officers to engage in agricultural activities. As per the said instructions, Public Administration Circular No.15/2022 dated 2022\u201106\u201115 has been issued to be valid for a period of 03 months. However, considering the fact that the public transportation is being restored and a sufficient period of time was granted for the initial agricultural activities, the proposal made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government to cancel the said circular with immediate effect, was approved by the Cabinet.",
