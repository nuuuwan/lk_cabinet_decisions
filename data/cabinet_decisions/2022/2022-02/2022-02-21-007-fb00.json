  "decision_details": "- The Community Police Service functioning in the countries such as Japan and Singapore, has been found possible to reduce the rate of minor crimes committed at the community level. Based on the success of such programmes, the Ministry of Public Security together with the State Ministry of Community Police Service and the Sri Lanka Police have taken action to attach two police officers for each Grama Niladhari Division, under the Community Police Service, commencing from May 2021, on full time basis. Accordingly, two young people residing in each Grama Niladhari Division have been planned to attach  as \u201cCommunity Assistants (Voluntary)\u201d, in order to obtain the required support to have community participation to accomplish the duties of the police officers. Youths over the age of 18 years and permanent residents of  relevant Grama Niladhari Divisions and who have served as prefects in their schools and holding the membership of youth clubs and other volunteer groups can apply for this. They may provide a honorable service whereas they are not entitled to any allowance or any other right. The Sri Lanka Police will issue them a volunteer identity card and after the expiry of 6 months period they will be awarded a service certificate on \u201cCommunity Leadership\u201d. Accordingly, the Cabinet decided to grant its concurrence for the arrangement presented by the Minister of Public Security on the implementation of the proposed programme.",
