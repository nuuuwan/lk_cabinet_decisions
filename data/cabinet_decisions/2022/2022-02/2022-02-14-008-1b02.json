  "decision_details": "- The present active vehicle fleet of Sri Lanka is over 05 million, showing a three-fold increase than the year 2000. It is observed that this is due to the increase in the import of private vehicles particularly Three Wheeler, Motor Bikes and Motor Cars. Further, it appears that there is a great tendency for the use of private vehicles due to the increase of income level and the difficulties encountered when using the existing public transport service and the rapid increase of the use of private vehicles has resulted in decrease of the use of non motorized modes of transport. The use of non-motorized modes of transport will cause a positive impact on minimizing air pollution, the physical health, air quality, environment, climate change and personnel finance. Therefore, it has been identified that integrating the non-motorized modes with the existing transport system would be appropriate  to accrue the economical and environmental benefits.  Accordingly, the Cabinet having taken into consideration the matters submitted by the Minister of Environment, granted its concurrence for the relevant Ministries and Institutes to take the following action  under an integrated approach:\n\n    \u2022 Marking bicycle lanes for existing roads in an appropriate manner and upgrading of the existing walking paths.\n\n    \u2022 Inclusion of bicycle lanes and walking paths for roads to be constructed in future\n\n    \u2022 Taking necessary action to promote the use of bicycles among the government officers; and\n\n    \u2022 Providing necessary facilities including bicycle parking facility and accessibility for the bicycle users in the offices.",
