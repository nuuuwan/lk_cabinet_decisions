  "decision_details": "- Organ, Tissue and Cell Transplantation is considered as a successful treatment practice to safe guard the lives of the patients with end stage internal organ failures including kidney, liver, heart, lungs and pancreas transplantation. At present, organ transplantation surgeries are done in 09 government hospitals including the two main national centres in Colombo and Kandy. It has been found the necessity of having a national policy on organ transplantation in order to improve the living conditions of the donors, their family members as well as the donor recipients and to preserve their rights. Accordingly, the National Policy on Organs, Tissues and Cell Transplantation of Sri Lanka has been formulated based on the 57th Resolution of the World Health Assembly and the Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation of the world Health Organization. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Health to implement the said project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
