  "decision_details": "- The Samanalawewa Power Station is in commercial operation since 1992 with an installed capacity of 120 MW and with an annual electricity generation around 276GWh. This power station plays a significant role in catering to the electricity demand in peak hours and maintaining the network voltage in the southern province. The power station is operating with two generators with a life span of 25-30 years. Therefore, the life span of the said generators are nearing at their end and they have to be repaired soon. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Power to follow the formal procurement procedure for the purchase of two Generator Stators from the GEC Large Machines Ltd, of United Kingdom, which is the original equipment manufactures of those generators, was approved by the Cabinet.",
