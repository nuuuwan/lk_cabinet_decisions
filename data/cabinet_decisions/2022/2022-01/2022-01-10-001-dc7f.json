  "decision_details": "- The programme for resettlement of families residing in areas with landslide risks is being implemented in 14 districts and 1,558 families have been resettled under this programme. Also, although there is no risk of landslides, it has been observed the appropriateness of including such families in the resettlement programme to relocate families who are constantly affected by disasters such as coastal erosion, river bank wahsouts and constant submerging with floods. Accordingly, the requirement of resettling 42 families affected by constant floods due to overflowing of the Buthgamuwa Canal in 514 Welikada East Grama Niladhari Division in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Divisional Secretariat Division during rainy season, in another location has been identified. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence to remove the said 42 families from their residences and provide them with 42 houses from the housing projects implemented by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) for the persons with low\u2011income, was approved by the Cabinet.",
