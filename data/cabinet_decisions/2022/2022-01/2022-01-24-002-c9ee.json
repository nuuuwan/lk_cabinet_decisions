  "decision_details": "- This project which is being implemented for low income earning families residing in temporary houses, provides a financial assistance subject to a maximum of Rs.600,000/- per each selected beneficiary family depending on the progress of the construction of the house. This project was started in 2020, and with the considerable increase of the prices of construction materials, it has found difficult to construct a complete house as expected with the grant of Rs.600,000/-. Therefore, the proposal  made by the Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Urban Development and Housing, to increase the grant provided under the said programe for selected beneficiary families up to Rs.650,000/- from 2022 onwards, was approved by the Cabinet.",
