  "decision_details": "- The Government has taken a policy decision to reach carbon neutrality by the year 2050. In view of meeting the said objective, the necessity has been identified to change energy supply value chains and to shift from fossil fuel to cleaner energy production and consumption gradually. As such, action should be taken to reduce air emissions in power and transport sectors as well as in thermal used industries. Within these circumstances, Greenstat Hydrogen India Pvt. Ltd., a subsidiary of Greenstat AS of Norway, has agreed to conduct a feasibility study on a Pilot Project to generate Green Hydrogen using a combination of floating solar and wind. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Energy to enter into an agreement between the Sri Lanka Petroleum Development Authority and Greenstat Hydrogen India (Pvt.) Ltd. to conduct the said feasibility study, was approved by the Cabinet.",
