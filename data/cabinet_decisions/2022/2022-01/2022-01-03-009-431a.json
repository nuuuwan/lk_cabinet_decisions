  "decision_details": "- The Government has taken a policy decision to take necessary action to generate 70% of the electricity requirement of the country by the renewable energy and to reach carbon neutrality at the electricity generation by the year 2030. The Solar Power Systems installed on roof tops currently provide a capacity of 400 MW to the national grid of the Country. Encouraging consumers to install battery systems for these systems on self-financed investment through a new tariff system will enable the public to secure a more reliable supply of electricity. In this context, An Officials Committee was appointed to identify the technical challenges that could arise in connecting high percentage of electricity receiving from the renewable energy to the national grid and submit recommendation on the same and the Cabinet at its meeting held on 2021\u201111\u201123 decided to appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee to further study matters on the recommendations of the said Officials Committee. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Power to implement the proposed programme as per the recommendations submitted by the said Cabinet Sub-Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
