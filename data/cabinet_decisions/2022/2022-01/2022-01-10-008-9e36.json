  "decision_details": "- Haputhale Police Station has been established since 1928 on a land in extent of 01 acre 01 rood  and 9.8 perches located in a railway reserve belonging to the Sri Lanka Railway.  Since the said land where the police station is located has not yet been formally vested with the Sri Lanka Police, it has been unable to construct new buildings required for the Police or to carry out renovations spending money. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Security to vest the said block of land with the Sri Lanka Police, was approved by the Cabinet.",
