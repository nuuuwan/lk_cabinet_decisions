  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2015\u201102\u201118 to draft the Children (Judicial Protection) Bill so that Courts can be established to exercise jurisdiction and other forms of jurisdiction over children to hear cases relating to children in need of care and protection or to prosecute a child who violates the law. Accordingly, the preliminary draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman has been studied by two committees of experts and further proposals have been submitted. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare the final draft Bill incorporating the proposals of the said committees also in the preliminary draft Bill that has already been prepared, was approved by the Cabinet.",
