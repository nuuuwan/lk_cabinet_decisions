  "decision_details": "- The Trade Facilitation Agreement of the World Trade Organization is in operation since February, 2017 and Sri Lanka is also a party to the Agreement. According  to the said Trade Agreement, Sri lanka is obliged to initiate and maintain a single place (Single Window) to submit documents and data requirements by traders on their border trade flows (importation, exportation and transshipment) to the participatory border trade regulating authorities. A formal plan relating to the project has been developed in the year 2018 under the financial assistance of the World Bank. The estimated cost of this project to be implemented under three stages as per the said plan is approximately US$ 15 million and it is expected to secure the funds required for the purpose from the World bank and other development stakeholders. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization & National Policies to implement the proposed \u201cNational Single Window Project\u201d, was approved by the Cabinet.",
