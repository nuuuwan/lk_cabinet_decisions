  "decision_details": "- In terms of the Public Administration Circular No.423, instructions have been given to the effect that necessary laws be amended to liquidate the dormant statutory funds. Accordingly, measures have been taken to liquidate the Rubber Control Fund established under the Rubber Control Act, No.11of 1956 and the Rubber Replanting Fund established under the Rubber Replanting Subsidy Act, No.36 of 1953. Since the provisions relating to the Rubber Control Fund and the Rubber Replanting Fund incorporated in the said two Acts are no longer required, it is necessary to amend those Acts. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Plantation Industries to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to amend the Rubber Control Act, No.11of 1956 and the Rubber Replanting Subsidy Act, No.36 of 1953, was approved by the Cabinet.",
