  "decision_details": "- In accordance with the existing provisions, a public officer is entitled to no pay leave for a maximum period of 05 years during their service period for academic and foreign employment. Nevertheless, Public servants are less interested in obtaining such leaves due to the non consideration of that period in the calculation of pension, impact caused to the seniority and other conditions. Taking into account the current economic situation in the country, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government to issue the relevant Circular instructions revising the existing provisions, enabling the public officials to obtain no pay foreign leaves for a period of five (05) years without any prejudice to their seniority and pension to employ in abroad or to engage in any other productive activity, was approved by the Cabinet.",
