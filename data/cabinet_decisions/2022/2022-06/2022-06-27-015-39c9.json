  "decision_details": "- Daily requirement of aviation fuel for aircraft in and outside Sri Lanka is approximately 1.2 million litres and under the current situation in the country, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has been unable to provide at least the minimum quantity of fuel required to sustain the operations of domestic and foreign airlines as well. Under this circumstance, the joint proposal made by the Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation and the Minister of Power and Energy to grant permission for the Bunkers registered under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority to import, supply and sell Jet A-1 aviation fuel in order to continue the airline services without any hindrance, was approved by the cabinet.",
