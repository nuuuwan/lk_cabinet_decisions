  "decision_details": "- The Government has decided to submit an amended Appropriation Bill to Parliament in lieu of the Appropriation Act No. 30 of 2021 due to the fact that expenses had to be borne for the other essential activities apart from the functions for which allocations had been made under Appropriation Act from the middle of the first quarter of 2022 in view of prevailing worst economic situation and that the structure of Ministries that existed at the time of passing the Appropriation Bill for the year 2022 has changed significantly at present. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a draft to amend the Appropriation Bill No. 30 of 2021, was approved by the Cabinet.",
