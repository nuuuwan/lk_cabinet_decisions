  "decision_details": "- Several international reports published on the protection of womens' rights have pointed out that making mandatory the submission of a 'Family Background Report' in view of ensuring that the children of female migrant workers who go abroad for domestic work are not less than 05 years of age, has adversely impacted on womens' rights. Also, it has been reported that women who are anticipating to go abroad are inconvenienced by certain officers, by delaying the reports on several grounds, in spite that women have duly qualified to be issued that report. It has further been reported that some women who are not qualified to submit the said report have gone abroad through other illegal ways without any supervision and faced various problems. Taking into consideration the matters submitted to the Cabinet by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment in this regard, the Cabinet decided to exempt women who have children of two (02) years of age or above from the compulsory requirement to submit a Family Background Report when going abroad for employment.",
