  "decision_details": "- The Department of Sri Lanka Railways adopts a concessionary fare scheme for passenger transport in line with the Government policies. However, with the rapid hike of fuel prices, the recurrent loss of the Department of Railways is escalating and therefore it has been essential to raise the income generated by the Department so that a satisfactory railway service could be maintained. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Transport and Highways to revise the railway passenger transport fare which has not been revised for more than five (05) years and the railway charges for providing wagons for freight transport, mail transport and other goods which have not been increased for nearly 14 years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
