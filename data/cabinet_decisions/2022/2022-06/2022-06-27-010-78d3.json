  "decision_details": "- Due to the absence of a definition on the offense of contempt of court in Sri Lanka, there is no clear and uniform procedure for hearing and determining such cases at present. Therefore, it has been found difficult to understand limits of interference for the administration of justice and the limits under freedom of expression. Further, in considering the cases on contempt of court which have been severely criticized in the recent past, it has appeared that it is appropriate to reassess the relevant law. Accordingly, the Law Commission of Sri Lanka having studied the matters, has prepared a preliminary draft with a view to introducing appropriate laws. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a draft Bill to enact a new Law based on the preliminary draft, was approved by the Cabinet.",
