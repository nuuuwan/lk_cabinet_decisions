  "decision_details": "- Labour tribunals since the inception have granted opportunities to representatives of trade unions and representatives who are not attorneys at law to appear in labour tribunals, on an equal basis as lawyers, representing their parties. However, during the recent times, several issues have been emerged in the instances where representatives who are not attorneys-at-law appear in labour tribunals. In order to prevent the occurrence of such incidents, approval of the Cabinet has been granted at its meeting held on 2017 02 21 to amend the Industrial Disputes Act, No.43 of 1950, so that a representative conferred by relevant parties could appear before the Commissioner of Labour or any authorized officer, arbitrator, industrial court or labour tribunal. Clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman.  Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, to publish the said Bill in the Government Gazette and thereafter, present the same in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
