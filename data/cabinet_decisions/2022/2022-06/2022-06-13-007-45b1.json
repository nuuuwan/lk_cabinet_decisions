  "decision_details": "- Public transportation has been disrupted due to the prevailing fuel shortage which has made it difficult for public officials to access their transport facilities. In this context, it seems appropriate to grant leave for public officials for one working day of the week and provide them with the necessary facilities to engage in agricultural activities in their home garden or elsewhere as a solution to food shortage which could arise in the near future. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government to close Public institutions on Fridays for the period of next three months other than those providing essential services such as Water, Electricity, Health, Defence Services, Education, Transport, Ports and Airport, was approved by the Cabinet.",
