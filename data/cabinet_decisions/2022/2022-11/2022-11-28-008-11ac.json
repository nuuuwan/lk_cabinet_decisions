  "decision_details": "- Although action have been taken on several occasions to amend the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No.19 of 1931, the said amendments could not be completed due to the inability to reach an agreement on the views and suggestions made by several parties. An agreement has been reached between the relevant parties by now pertaining to the proposed proposals. Similarly, it has been decided to draft the Theravada Bhikku Kathikavath (Registration) Bill by further amending the preliminary draft Bill of the same, taking into consideration the views and suggestions made by the various parties to introduce an Act including provisions for enforcing the decision of the relevant Sangha Sabha in an instance where a certain Monk does not act according to a decision arrived by a Sangha Sabha of any Nikaya or Chapter. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs to take action to prepare a draft Bill to amend the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No.19 of 1931 and to draft the Theravada Bhikku Kathikavath (Registration) Bill, was approved by the Cabinet.",
