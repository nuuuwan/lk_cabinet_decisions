  "decision_details": "- In terms of the Cabinet decision dated 2012\u201112\u201105, the Legal Draftsman has been directed to draft a Bill to amend the National Archives Act, No.48 of 1973. Accordingly, the Legal Draftsman has drafted a Bill and further the Legal Draftsman has informed that the policy approval of the present Cabinet is required for the said Bill. However, since audio-video records, cinematograph records and digital records are largely produced for the conservation process in addition to paper records, the need has been identified to further amend the National Archives Act so as to suit to the international standards and national requirements. As such the proposal made by the Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, to appoint a committee consisting of experts on document management, document preservation and digitalized document management and identify appropriate amendments and thereafter, take necessary action incorporate appropriate amendments to further amend the said Bill that has already been drafted by the Legal Draftsman, was approved by the Cabinet.",
