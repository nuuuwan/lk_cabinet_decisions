  "decision_details": "- Due to various human activities taking place at present such as certain irregular land use and agricultural practices, informal solid waste disposal and unsustainable use of natural resources, many problems such as ecosystem degradation, soil erosion, drying up of water sources and human-wildlife conflicts have to be encountered. As a result, the biodiversity and base of ecosystem service have been threatened. That situation will lead to a vicious cycle of ecosystem degradation in the long run. Therefore, it is expected through the establishment of the National Policy on Environmental Sensitive Areas to ensure a healthy, safe and conserved environment and economy thereby establishing environmental sensitive areas for social-economic well being and livable environment for all. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Environment to implement the National Policy on Environmental Sensitive Areas in Sri Lanka in order to provide the necessary guidance for the conservation of environmentally sensitive areas and their sustainable utilization by identifying the environmentally sensitive areas across the Island and with the participation of all sectors such as community, private sector, state sector and experts for the land use planning and management of those areas and ensuring a co\u2011management approach at all levels, was approved by the Cabinet.",
