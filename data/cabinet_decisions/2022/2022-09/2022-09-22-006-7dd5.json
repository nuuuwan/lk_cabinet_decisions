  "decision_details": "- Approximately, 600,000 metric tons of maize is annually required for animal feed production and at present, there is a dire scarcity of maize in the market. Although licensees have been issued to import 225,000 metric tons of maize through food manufacturing companies and sellers of animal feed prior to 2022\u201112\u201131, only 38,000 metric tons of maize have been imported by the end of June, owing to the existing shortage of foreign exchange. The price of one kilogram of maize in the local market has increased up to Rs 220/- resulting a hike in the prices of animal feed also. Accordingly, the prices of chicken and eggs have also increased. It has been observed that there might be a severe crisis in the field of animal husbandry in the near future due to the fact that those involved in poultry farming are attempting to sell eggs without breeding chickens and leaving the industry. As such the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, to grant permission for the Food Promotion Board to import 25,000 metric tons of maize or other suitable grains for animal feed production as recommended by the Department of Animal Production and Health, was approved by the Cabinet.",
