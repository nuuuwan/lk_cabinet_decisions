  "decision_details": "- The State Literary Awards Festival, the National Literary Festival and the National Literary Arts Festival are annually conducted to promote literature, arts, aesthetics and related fields. Owing to the existing economic circumstances in the country, conducting of such festivals during this year would not be appropriate and instead of that, it has been planned to conduct the \u201cNational Literary Arts Festival\u201d incorporating all the unique features of those literary festivals. Accordingly, the Cabinet granted its concurrence for the proposal made by the Minister of Budhhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs to conduct the said festival at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall from 27th October to 30th October 2022 jointly with the  State  and private sector institutions.",
