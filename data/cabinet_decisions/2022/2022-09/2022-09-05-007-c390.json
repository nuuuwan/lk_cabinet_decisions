  "decision_details": "- Sanitation is defined as the safe management of domestic wastewater and human excreta as well as institutional, commercial and industrial wastewater including their safe confinement, treatment, disposal and associated hygiene related practices. The United Nations Organization, in its agenda of Sustainable Development Goals has identified provision of sanitary services as a major requirement in a country's development. Accordingly, in order to achieve the sustainable development goals relating to the provision of sanitary facilities, the Ministry of Water Supply has prepared the National Policy on Sanitation and Sanitation Master Plan in consultation with the relevant parties including the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government, while ensuring that all stakeholders operate within a common framework with proper coordination and monitoring. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Water Supply to implement the proposed policy covering the period from 2021-2030, was approved by the Cabinet.",
