  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted to introduce new legislation on registration of foreign divorces and acceptance of annulments or judicial separations and as such, a draft Bill is being prepared by the Legal Draftsman for the purpose. The Marriage Registration Ordinance should include the terms to be met for the registration of marriages and since the said Ordinance does not include provisions for registration of foreign divorces and annulments or judicial separations, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to amend the Marriage Registration Ordinance and to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a draft Bill for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
