It has been identified that construction of 02 hotels of 4 star category in the close proximity of the airport would attract tourists and it may create a more favorable environment.  For the purpose, two land lots each in extent of 15 hectares located on the right side of the Terminal Building of the Airport have been identified. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Tourism to Request for Proposals from the investors for the establishment of the proposed 02 hotels, was approved by the Cabinet.",
