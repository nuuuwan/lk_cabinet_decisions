  "decision_details": "- The Sub-Committee to draft the Matrimonial Causes Bill has been appointed as one of the Sub-Committees of the Special Unit of the Ministry of Justice formed with the approval of the Cabinet for bringing a widespread reform of the law. The said Sub-Committee has prepared a draft incorporating the preliminary provisions on the grounds for divorce, separation and nullity, the procedure for matrimonial actions and the matters that should be taken into account in granting the custody of children. Chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code contains the procedure in relation to the matrimonial actions and with the coming into operation of the proposed Matrimonial Causes Act, that Chapter will be redundant. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to instruct the Legal Draftsman to repeal the Chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code and draft a Bill for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
