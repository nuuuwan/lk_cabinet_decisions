  "decision_details": "- The Post Office Security Fund has been established under the Post Office Security Fund Ordinance No.1 of 1931. Although the approval of the Cabinet had been granted previously to amend the Post Office Security Fund Ordinance so as to provide a more productive service to the members of the Department of Posts, relevant drafting process has not yet been finalized. Therefore, the proposal made by the Minister of Mass Media to draft the said Bill through the Legal Draftsman, incorporating relevant provisions to suit the present day requirements, was approved by the Cabinet.",
