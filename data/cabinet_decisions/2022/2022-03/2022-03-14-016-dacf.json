  "decision_details": "- With a view to strengthening the process of administration of justice and facilitating the functions of courthouses and prisons, it has been decided to conduct virtual court sessions as and when required. Accordingly, the Digitalization and Court Automation Law Committee and the Civil Law Reforms Sub\u2011Committee appointed by the Minister of Justice to look into these matters have recommended that it would be appropriate to amend the Civil Procedure Code by inserting new sections 167(A) to 167(N), with a view to incorporating provisions pertaining to oral testimony provided by a witness in an open court. As such, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to amend the Civil Procedure Code based on the said recommendations and instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft a Bill for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
