  "decision_details": "- The necessity of enacting provisions has been identified to provide for legal redresses to donors where donees force out the donors who gift their properties irrevocably, from the said properties and the donees transfer the relevant property to another third party fraudulently. Approval of the Cabinet has been granted previously to introduce amendments to the Revocation of Irrevocable Deeds of Gift on the Ground of Gross Ingratitude Act, No.5 of 2017. As such, clearance of the Attorney General has been received for the draft Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Justice to publish the said draft Bill in the Government Gazette and submit the same thereafter in Parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet.",
