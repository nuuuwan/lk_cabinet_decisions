  "decision_details": "- this Regulation stipulates a levy of Rs.20/- per animal for registering cattle by the Government Veterinary Surgeon, fixing an ear tag with an identification number on each head of cattle. The cattle identification system is fundamental for tracing of animal either for disease control or for breeding. The Department concerned find it difficult to carry out the cattle identification programme as planned due to the small farmers as well as large herd owners not extending their cooperation in this regard, which seriously affects the dairy development programmes of the Government. The proposal made by Hon. Arumugan Thondaman, Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development, to carry out the cattle identification programme free of charge for a period of 02 years by suspending the enforcement of Regulation No.22, to overcome the present difficulty, was approved by the Cabinet.",
