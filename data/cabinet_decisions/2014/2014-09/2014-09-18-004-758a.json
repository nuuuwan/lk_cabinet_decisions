  "decision_details": "- every year since 1986, the \u201cWorld Habitat Day\u201d is celebrated on the first Monday in the month of October by the United Nations with the aim of drawing the attention of the global community to key issues related to development of urban housing and human settlements. The United Nations has declared \u201cVoices from Slums\u201d as the theme of this year's World Habitat Day which falls on Monday the 06th October 2014. The theme is intended to reflect on development activities implemented while listening to the voices of the people living in slums. The Government has accorded the highest priority to the provision of housing and settlement facilities to low income earners in the City of Colombo and other urban zones throughout the country. The Ministry of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities, intends to conduct several programmes under the above theme to mark the World Habitat Day. The proposal made by Hon. Wimal Weerawansa, Minister of Construction, Engineering Services, Housing and Common Amenities, to proceed with the related activities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
