  "decision_details": "-  Thalpitigala Reservoir Project envisages the construction of a 45.7 m. high dam across Uma Oya at Thalpitigala and the reservoir will have a capacity of 15.6 million cu.m.   It will provide improved irrigation water for 810 hectares in the Bathmedilla Scheme currently served by water from Vela Oya and supplemented by diversion from Uma Oya.  This will ensure meeting drinking water supply requirements and irrigation requirements at Menipe and Bathmedilla Anicuts among downstream water users in the area.   The project also envisages the construction of a hydro?power station with a capacity of 2 x 7.5 MW that will generate 51 GWh of hydro?power annually to feed the National Grid.  The proposal made by Hon.
