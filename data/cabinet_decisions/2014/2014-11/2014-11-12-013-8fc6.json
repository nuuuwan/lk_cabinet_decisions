  "decision_details": "- development of the road network which is currently underway connecting 38,000 villages will enable better access to nearly 80% of the population living in rural areas. The Mullaitivu - Kokilai - Pulmudai Road has been identified as a priority road for development with the view to providing continuous land connectivity on the coastal belt between the Eastern Province and the Northern Province. It is proposed to construct a bridge across the Kokilai Lagoon which will greatly reduce the distance between Mullaitivu and Pulmudai by about 100 km. The proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning, to proceed with the activities relating to loan arrangements for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
