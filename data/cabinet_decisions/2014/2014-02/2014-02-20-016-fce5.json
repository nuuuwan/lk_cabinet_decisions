  "decision_details": "- since the volume of traffic in the city of Colombo has increased significantly during the past few years, it is proposed to construct an elevated road network to divert the Colombo traffic to the expressway network in order to minimize the traffic congestion. In the meantime, the Government plans to build a new bridge across the Kelani River, linking Colombo city and Colombo - Katunayake Expressway to mitigate and disperse the increased traffic congestion in the city areas.  The new bridge is expected to be constructed parallel to the existing new Kelani bridge using advanced Japanese technology and the project has been designed by considering the estimated future traffic volume around the Kelani bridge from 2022 to 2035.  The Government of Japan has agreed to provide a loan amounting to Japanese Yen 35,020 million (approximately Rs.45,526 million) through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the construction of the second new Kelani bridge.  The proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance and Planning, was approved by the Cabinet.",
