With the view to providing an uninterrupted supply of good quality medical supplies at an affordable price to the people of Sri Lanka, the proposal made by Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, Minister of Health, to sign the above Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
