  "decision_details": "- the intention of the government is to reach self sufficiency in all livestock produce and the dairy industry has been identified as a key area to be developed as a local industry.  Sri Lanka has reached 40% self sufficiency by producing 299 million litres of milk in 2012 which is a 16% increase when compared to that of 2011.  40% of the cost of production of a litre of milk is borne by concentrated feed which is mainly a mixture of Maize, Rice Bran, Coconut Poonac and Wheat Bran together with minerals and vitamins. The proposal made by Hon. Arumugan Thondaman, Minister of Livestock and Rural Community Development, to take measures to restrict the export of Coconut Poonac and Rice Bran, so that these could be made available for dairy feed at affordable prices, was approved by the Cabinet.",
