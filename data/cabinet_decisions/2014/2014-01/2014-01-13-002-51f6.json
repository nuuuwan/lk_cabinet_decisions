  "decision_details": "- the Sri Lanka Ports Authority is planning to set up 2 Dry Ports at Peliyagoda and Thelangapatha and has identified 100 acres  for the Dry Port Zone of which 30 acres will be developed initially.  An inland port has a level of integration with the maritime terminal and supports a more efficient access to the inland market both for inbound and outbound traffic.  The proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Highways, Ports and Shipping, to authorize the Permanent Country Representative to the UN in New York to sign the Agreement on Dry Ports on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka and become a party to the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Dry Ports, was approved by the Cabinet.",
