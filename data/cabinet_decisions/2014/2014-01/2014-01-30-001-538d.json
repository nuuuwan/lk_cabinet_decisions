  "decision_details": "- at present, there are nearly 2.2 million mobile phone users in the country and the TRCSL has decided to set up a National Equipment Identity Register for use of all Mobile Operators with the aim of curtailing the counterfeit mobile phone market and to discourage mobile phone theft so as to protect the consumers.  This NEIR acts as a central system for all network operators to ensure that black listed mobile terminals in one network will not work on other networks even if the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Card in the device is changed.  The proposal made by H.E. the President, to proceed with the relevant activities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
