  "decision_details": "- it is obligatory on the part of Sri Lanka, being a party to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention - 1944), to make arrangements for the effective implementation of the International Standards and Recommended Practices contained in the said Convention.  It is a requirement that every State enters into arrangements with neighbouring States to strengthen her ability to provide  Search and Rescue Services in mutual cooperation and coordination with each other when the need for search and rescue arises.  According to an international survey conducted relating to air safety measures adopted by countries (USOAP-2013), Sri Lanka has attained the 19th place out of 191 countries in the world and the 4th place out of 34 countries in the Asia Pacific Region.  The proposal made by Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne, Minister of Civil Aviation, to make certain adjustments to the original text of the Arrangements as requested by the Maldivian Authorities, which do not change the objective of the Arrangements, was approved by the Cabinet.",
