Accordingly, the Ceylon Electricity Board intends to implement the following 2 projects: \r\n\r\n*\tProject of 'Construction of Four Grid Substations and Related Transmission Line' - it is expected to add 4 new sub-stations under this project in the central region at Nawalapitiya, Ragala, Wewalwatte and Maliboda at an estimated cost of Euro 38 mn.  These 4 sub-stations will add 220 MW of additional capacity to the National grid; and\r\n\r\n*\tProject of 'Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment Program' - this programme will be implemented by the Government with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and an Agency from France.
