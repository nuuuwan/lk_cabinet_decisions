This project is being implemented with funding from the Asian Development Bank, France, and the Government of Sri Lanka. The proposal made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, to award the above tender to the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), was approved by the Cabinet. \r\n\r\n\tCabinet decided that the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage should obtain the concurrence of the Northern Provincial Council for the project, as it is reported that certain political leaders in the area are not in favour of diverting the excess water of Iranamadu tank to Jaffna.",
