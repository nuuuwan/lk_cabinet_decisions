  "decision_details": "- The Road Development Authority (RDA) has identified the need to construct flyovers at Rajagiriya, Polgahawela and Ganemulla. A flyover at Rajagiriya is required to be constructed urgently to ease traffic congestion, minimize accidents and to reduce high vehicle operating costs.  Flyovers at Ganemulla and Polgahawela are especially required to avoid long delays that are being experienced  by road users due to frequent closure of railway gates at the level crossings. The proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as Minister of Highways, Ports and Shipping, to award the contract for the construction of the three flyovers referred to above, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), was approved by the Cabinet.",
