  "decision_details": "- Since the enactment of this Ordinance, many new laws have been introduced by Parliament, providing for the regularizing and control of certain criminal activities which also resulted in the introduction of new offences in order to combat the commission of such crimes. A need therefore has now arisen to enable those accused of committing some of the offences introduced by these laws, also to be fingerprinted. The proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, Minister of Justice, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft amending legislation for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
