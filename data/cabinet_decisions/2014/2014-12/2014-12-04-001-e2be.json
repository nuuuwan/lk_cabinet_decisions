  "decision_details": "- The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping (STWC) 1978 has made it mandatory for a seafarer holding maritime certificates issued to him by the maritime administration of his country to obtain a similar Certificate of Recognition from the country concerned to serve on ships flying its flag. The Merchant Shipping Act, No.52 of 1971 also highlights the compliance with this requirement.  Sri Lanka has already entered into Agreements with 28 countries whereby a large number of Sri Lankan seafarers are provided with opportunities to serve on foreign vessels.  The Republic of Korea has expressed its willingness to enter into a Bilateral Agreement regarding the issuance of the said certificates which will enable Sri Lankan seafarers to serve on ships flying the Korean flag and Korean seafarers to serve on ships registered under the Sri Lankan flag.  The proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Highways, Ports and Shipping to sign the above Memorandum of Understanding between the two countries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
