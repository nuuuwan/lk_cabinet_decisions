Legislation will also be incorporated in the Act for 10% of the total weight of the Tuna fish landed at any harbour or Fish Landing Centre in Sri Lanka, under the authority of a landing permit, to be made available to the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation for purchase at a price to be agreed by the Corporation. The proposal made by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, Hon.
