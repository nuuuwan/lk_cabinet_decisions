  "decision_details": "- Large quantities of seeds such as potatoes, maize, onions, beans are imported annually to Sri Lanka for cultivation purposes costing over Rs. 1000 million as foreign exchange. It has been noticed that local farmers prefer to have local seed varieties due to their higher productivity and resistance to pests and diseases  and as such, on a proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Cabinet approval was granted in principle for the production of seed varieties in Sri Lanka with the participation of both State and the Private Sector, on a programme to be developed for the purpose, and to provide facilities for same at the 19 State owned farms at Mahailluppallama, Aluththarama, Bata-Atha, Middeniya, Seeta Eliya, Kandapola, Meepilimana etc.  It was also decided to put idle lands at State Farms to productive use with the assistance of the Armed Forces so that they could be developed and cultivated.",
