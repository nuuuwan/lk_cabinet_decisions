  "decision_details": "- since it has been observed that concrete roads are more durable and require less maintenance than the roads constructed with bitumen, it has been decided that rehabilitation / construction of roads and highways in future should be with concrete surfacing where it is viable.  Accordingly, the Road Development Authority has selected 600 Km of highways for rehabilitation through domestic contractors, as a pilot project.  On a proposal made by H.E. the President, Cabinet approval was granted to call for technical and financial proposals from eligible domestic contractors for rehabilitation of roads by using concrete surfacing and for appointment of a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (CANC) and Project Committee (PC) to evaluate the proposals submitted.",
