  "decision_details": "- Shipwrecks are considered as the heritage of the nation, representing historical, cultural and archeological value and the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) is the Government Institution responsible for the management, development and conservation of Aquatic Resources. Very old wrecks are a major attraction for underwater photographers, divers and tourists. On a proposal made by the Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, Cabinet approval was granted for the preparation of a long term broad based management plan for Sri Lanka's maritime wrecks and underwater cultural heritage, based on a thorough survey to be carried out by NARA and in association with the Ministries of Economic Development; Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development; Environment; and National Heritage.",
