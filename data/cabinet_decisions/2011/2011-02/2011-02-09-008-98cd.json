  "decision_details": "- this Unit is functioning under the Ministry of Resettlement with financial assistance provided by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees for implementing the resettlement programme and for coordinating activities for the provision of shelter and livelihood facilities for the Internally Displaced Persons who are being resettled. About 90% of the displaced persons have been resettled and facilities have to be provided for the rest who are still in Relief Villages mainly due to de-mining activities taking place in their native places.  On a proposal made by Hon. Gunaratne Weerakoon, Minister of Resettlement, Cabinet approval was granted for the continuous functioning of the National Coordinating Unit for a further period of one year from 01.01.2011.",
