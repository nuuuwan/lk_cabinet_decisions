  "decision_details": "- the present policy is to   reserve 0.5% of the proposed intake in each course of study for the benefit of foreign students. The proposal by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education, to increase the intake of foreign students to the Sri Lankan Universities initially from 0.5% to 5% and later to 10% based on the success of the initial stage,without reducing the opportunities for local students, was approved by the Cabinet. This would not only gain additional foreign exchange to the country, but will also give wide publicity throughout the world for the quality of education in Sri Lanka.",
