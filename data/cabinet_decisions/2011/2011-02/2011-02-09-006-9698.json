  "decision_details": "- Provisions under this Act enable the control of Import, Packing, Labeling, Storing, Mixing, Transporting, Selling and Utilizing pesticides to ensure its proper management.   Since the existing fines for violation of provisions in the above Act have been imposed nearly three decades back and also due to the increase of environmental and health hazards caused due to handling of pesticides in an irresponsible manner, on a proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardhana, Minister of Agriculture, Cabinet approval was granted to increase the fine on an individual, from Rs.50,000/- to Rs.100,000/- and on a Body Corporate such as registered companies or corporations, from Rs.100,000/- to Rs.500,000/- and to present the relevant Bill prepared by the Legal Draftsman in Parliament for approval. \r\n\r\n\tIt was also decided that an aggressive awareness campaign should be launched to educate farmers about the proper use of Agro chemicals and the disposal of empty containers in a non-hazardous manner.",
