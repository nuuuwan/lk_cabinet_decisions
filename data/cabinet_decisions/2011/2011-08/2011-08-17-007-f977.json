  "decision_details": "- Mannar and the adjoining coastal areas have been identified  as suitable for setting up of the first dedicated Wind Energy Park. Activities including selection of  sites, preparation of perimeter survey plans, acquisition of lands, preparation of detailed Wind Resource Maps are in progress. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have agreed to provide technical assistance for the purpose and the ADB has already committed funds through its loan package for 2012 to meet the infrastructure cost of the Wind Farm including the construction of 220 KV Grid Substation at Mannar and transmission line to Mannar via Vavuniya or Anuradhapura.  In order to provide an opportunity for participation of small and medium scale private investors in investing on Wind Project, the company already incorporated under the Ceylon Electricity Board is to be broad based with 51% of the shares to be held by the CEB and 49% by the Small and Medium Scale Investors. The above proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Power and Energy was approved by the Cabinet, subject to carrying out of an environmental impact assessment.",
