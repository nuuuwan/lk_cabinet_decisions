  "decision_details": "- Yan Oya has been identified as a major river basin where the water resources have not been fully developed.  Yan Oya boarders to Northern and Eastern Provinces and developing its water resources will provide the much needed irrigation water to this region  and also domestic water to the consumers.  This will benefit the vast population in the conflict affected areas in the North and the East.  The proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, on the recommendations of the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and the Project Committee, to award the contract for implementation of the above project and to secure foreign funding for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
