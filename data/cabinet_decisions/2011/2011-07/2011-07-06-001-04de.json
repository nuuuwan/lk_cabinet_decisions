  "decision_details": "- an Agreement has been signed by the Government of Sri Lanka with Cairn Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. pertaining to the exploration work of the above block which includes a minimum work programme including drilling. Drilling is the most technical and risky aspect of a petroleum exploration programme and drilling locations and drill depths may need changes at short notice due to operational difficulties and emergencies during drilling.  A thorough interpretation of the seismic survey conducted by the company has revealed that changes in the drilling programme is necessary.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President to proceed with the changes, was approved by the Cabinet.",
