  "decision_details": "- even though the concept of a Living Museum is rather strange to the Sri Lankan, this has been successfully implemented in many countries of the world. Under this concept action will be taken to exhibit the manner in which incidents of historical importance are being activated live in the form they took place in the past.  Under this project, while the infrastructure facilities of a selected part of the Dambana locality would be developed in a manner that would highlight the traditional lifestyle of the Indigenous Community, action would be taken to rebuild 15 houses in the traditional manner. It is also expected to promote tourist attraction through this programme. The above proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya, Minister of National Heritage utilizing Rs.22 million for the purpose from the funds provided to the Ministry for 2011, was approved by the Cabinet.",
