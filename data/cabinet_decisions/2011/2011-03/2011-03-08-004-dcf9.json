  "decision_details": "- the present practice has been for Sri Lanka to  enter into Bi-lateral Air Services Agreements to cover foreign civil aviation activities. However, a situation has now developed within the European Union of its Member States having under the process of European Integration agreed to align the key areas such civil aviation in accordance with the European Community Law. Under the circumstances, it has become necessary to amend the relevant Air Services Agreements. Since there are  26 countries to be covered and amending the Air Services Agreements individually would be a tedious process, on a joint  proposal made by Hon. (Prof.) G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs and Hon. Piyankara Jayaratne, Minister of Civil Aviation, Cabinet approval was granted to sign a Horizontal Agreement for the purpose between the European Community and the Government of Sri Lanka.",
