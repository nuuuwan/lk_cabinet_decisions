  "decision_details": "- the Budget 2011 presented by H.E. the President has proposed  a three year development programme for all Universities and additional funds have been allocated to transform the Universities of Peradeniya, Moratuwa, Colombo, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kelaniya and Ruhuna to a level of world class universities in their chosen fields.  The Government has observed that the urge for higher education among students passing G.C.E. (A/L) examination is on the increase and the number of places available in the State University System is however limited to about 21,000 per annum.  Another 60,000 students seek opportunities for higher education in the country.  Since it is necessary to improve the quality of all courses offered by all faculties of the Universities, on a proposal made by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, Minister of Higher Education, Cabinet approval was granted to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare legislation for a legal framework to provide for quality assurance and accreditation of institutions providing higher education, registration and regulation of Non-State Higher Educational Institutions.  A Council for Non-State Higher Education will also be established for the purpose.",
