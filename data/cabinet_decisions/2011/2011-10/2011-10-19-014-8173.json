  "decision_details": "- the issue pertaining to these officers was discussed in detail by the Cabinet and it was observed that quite a number of officers of this category covering duties / acting in the posts of Principals had been deprived of the opportunity of being successful at the Limited Competitive Examinations held in 2006 for recruitment of Principals to the Sri Lanka Principals' Service, as they had served with dedication and devotion towards the development of the academic as well as other extra curricular activities of these schools which were situated in difficult and extremely difficult areas where student attraction was minimal.  On the direction of H.E. the President and the Cabinet of Ministers, the authorities concerned have had consultations and discussions both in the legal sphere and with administrative authorities.  The time frame as well as the methodology for solving this problem have been discussed and agreed upon.",
