  "decision_details": "? the current Colombo \tConsumer Price Index is the country's official price index and is computed \tmonthly. The pattern used in computing is based on Household Income and \tExpenditure Survey 2002 and the average household expenditure of a sample \tof 1300 household from the Colombo urban area. This Price Index required \tregular revision based on current Consumer Expenditure Surveys. The \tproposal made by H.E. the President to adopt a new and improved Price \tIndex which reflects more realistically the changes in aggregate level of the \tConsumer Price,  based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey \t2006/07, with effect from June 2011 and to update it every 03 to 05 years \tbased on expenditure survey, was approved by the Cabinet.",
