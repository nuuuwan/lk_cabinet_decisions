  "decision_details": "- the Natural Science Museum established in 1986 is located within the premises of the Colombo Museum.   There are about 2000 natural science specimens exhibited here, which include specimens of mammals, birds, fish and plants.  It has been observed that there is a need for an Osteology Gallery within the Museum to keep the viewers aware of the skeletons of the vertebrates.  The proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya, Minister of National Heritage, to construct this Gallery in the Museum premises at a cost of Rs.39.6 million with funds to be provided under the Medium Term Budgetary Framework from 2012 - 2014 and to award the construction work to the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau, was approved by the Cabinet.",
