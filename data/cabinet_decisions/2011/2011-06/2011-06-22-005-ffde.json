  "decision_details": "- the current Atomic \tEnergy Authority Act enacted in 1969 needs to be amended to introduce \tNuclear Power Generation Technology in Sri Lanka and to address the \tsecurity concerns of radioactive sources and to deal with Radiation \tEmergencies. \r\nSince Sri Lanka is in close proximity to the Nuclear Power Stations in South India, it has been found necessary to establish an independent regulatory arm in keeping with the advice given by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Accordingly, the proposal made Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Power and Energy, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to prepare a Bill to establish an Atomic Energy Regulatory Council, was approved by the Cabinet.",
