  "decision_details": "- the Nagadeepa Major Irrigation Scheme is situated in the Nagadeepa Village in Ridimaliyadde DS Division in the Badulla District.  The main Dam of the Reservoir was constructed in 1965 to irrigate  2000 acres of agricultural lands.  It has been found that about 35% of the total extent of land is not cultivated during Yala Seasons by about 1100 farmer families living in the area due to the acute shortage of water in the Nagadeepa Scheme during Yala Seasons.  Construction of a Reservoir across Ulhitiya Oya at a location called Morana and diverting water to Rotagolla Wewa is identified as a measure to overcome this situation.  By the proposed construction, irrigation facilities could be provided to 3540 acres of paddy land, 2060 acres of other field crops during the Yala Season and it is expected to increase the paddy yield from 75 bushels to 90 bushels per acre.  The proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management, to implement the project of construction of Morana Reservoir  at a total cost of Rs.1700 million with funds to be provided under the Medium Term Expenditure Framework from 2012 to 2015, was approved by the Cabinet.",
