  "decision_details": "- this survey is vital to gather essential geo-information required for systematic mineral exploration of the country and hence, would be a key factor in attracting investors for mineral sector development. This would assist to identify areas for detailed ground surveys in the mineral sector.  It was not possible to conduct a survey of this nature covering the entire Island for the last three decades due to the conflict situation which prevailed in the North and the East. The proposal made by Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, Minister of Environment, to award the above contract, on the recommendations of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee and the Project Committee,  for a total cost of  US $16.4 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
