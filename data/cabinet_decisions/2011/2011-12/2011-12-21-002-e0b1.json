  "decision_details": "- it has been identified that one of the main reasons for coastal erosion in the Negombo-Chilaw Coastal Zone is excessive sand mining and the most appropriate solution to arrest this situation in the Marawila coastal region is sand feeding by means of sand mined from deep sea and construction of a few off shore break waters. The proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence and Urban Development, for the appointment of a Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee and a Technical Evaluation Committee to proceed with the work, was approved by the Cabinet.",
