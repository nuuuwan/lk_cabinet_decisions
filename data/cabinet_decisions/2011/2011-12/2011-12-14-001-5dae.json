  "decision_details": "- with the increased development activities taking place in the country after the conflict situation which prevailed some time  back, it has been observed that quite a large number of foreigners obtain resident visas to Sri Lanka to participate in these activities.  It has been found necessary to protect the public health needs of the Sri Lankan community and also the physical, mental and social needs of migrants.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, Minister of Health, for the implementation of a policy to conduct a health assessment for the resident visa applicants, was approved by the Cabinet.",
