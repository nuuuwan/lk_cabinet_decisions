  "decision_details": "- the proposal by Hon. Douglas Devananda, Minister of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise Development, for action to be taken by the Ministry to recommence operation of the Elephant Pass Saltern which is in a defunct state due to the conflict situation which prevailed in the Northern Province for nearly three decades, was approved by the Cabinet. This will generate employment opportunities in the Northern Province and will also help the Government to save foreign exchange spent on import of salt and salt base products. A suitable local investor is to be selected for the purpose through formal procedure and the relevant land and other assets will be leased out to the investor.",
