As per regulatory requirements applicable in most importing countries, certification methods of organic products are required to be monitored and certifying by a legally constituted agency, for the products to enter their markets. Accordingly, it was decided that the Ministries of Technology and Research; Industry and Commerce; and Agriculture should formulate a policy to strengthen the existing government institutions involved for the certification of organic products.",
