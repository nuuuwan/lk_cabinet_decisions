  "decision_details": "- there are about 10,000 Dhamma Schools registered at the Department of Buddhist Affairs and the number of students receiving Dhamma education is about 18 lakhs.  The Department of Buddhist Affairs has identified Dhamma Schools with less facilities in Pradesheeya Sasanarakshaka Balamandalayas throughout the island and has prepared a priority list of Dhamma Schools that should be developed very early in each Balamandala area.  On  a proposal made by Hon. D.M. Jayaratne, Prime Minister and Minister of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs, Cabinet approval was granted to develop 2600 such underdeveloped Dhamma Schools throughout the island, in keeping with the Sambuddhathwa Jayanthi Celebrations in 2011.",
