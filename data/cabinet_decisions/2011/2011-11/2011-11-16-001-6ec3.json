  "decision_details": "- road works that are being handled by the Road Development Authority has increased by many folds over the recent years and the government has observed that the present demand for bitumen is very high. At present the entire requirement of bitumen for road construction and maintenance works is supplied by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation which appears to be inadequate to meet the increased demand. This has caused delays in the implementation of Road Development Works. Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Ports and Highways,  for the Road Development Authority to import bitumen on the recommendation of the Ministry of Petroleum Industries, was approved by the Cabinet.",
