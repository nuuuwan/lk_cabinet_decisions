  "decision_details": "- it has been observed that one of the far-seeing initiatives that needs to be taken to prevent the resurgence of terrorism which ravaged the country for over three decades is to encourage the people of Sri Lanka to communicate effectively in all three languages. In recognition of this need, a Ten Year Plan formulated as the basis for a National Programme to motivate the people to acquire trilingual skills, presented to the Cabinet by H.E. the President, was approved for implementation. A Co-ordinating Unit for the purpose will be established at the Presidential Secretariat.  According to this Plan, the Year 2012 is to be declared as the Year for a Trilingual Sri Lanka.",
