  "decision_details": "- due to the expansion of the functions and responsibilities of the Ministry of External Affairs, the number of operational divisions and staff has increased fourfold over the past two decades. The Consular Affairs Division alone caters to over 1000 members of the public on daily basis. Despite the rented additional space, the Ministry continues to lack adequate space and facilities for the members of the staff, to carry out their functions effectively.  The Republic Building where the Ministry of External Affairs is located requires extensive repairs and maintenance which would not be cost effective in the long run.  Thus, the proposal made by Hon. G.L. Peiris, Minister of External Affairs, to relocate the Ministry of External Affairs at Battaramulla and to proceed with the formalities for the new building complex for the Ministry of External Affairs, was approved by the Cabinet.",
