  "decision_details": "- these projects are implemented in stages with community participation.  In addition to sharing a part of the cost of these projects, the communities carry out physical construction of facilities through Community Based Organizations formed within the community under the direction and support of the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage.   There are about 3500 Community Based Organizations covering approximately 600,000 families formed under this Scheme.  Most of the sub projects under this scheme have been successfully completed and the completed facilities are to be handed over to the respective  Community Based Organizations, for them to manage, maintain and sustain those. The proposal made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of  Water Supply and Drainage to create a Water Supply and Sanitation Trust for the purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
