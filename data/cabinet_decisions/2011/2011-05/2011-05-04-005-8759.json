  "decision_details": "- at present only 10% households use Kerosene for lighting purposes and majority of them are Samurdhi beneficiaries.    Even after 2012 when it is expected to reach 100% electrification in the country, there is to be about 40,000 households in very remote villages who will still be dependent on kerosene for their lighting.  On a proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, Minister of Power and Energy, a project has been developed, as a Government enabled private sector programme to commercially introduce advanced solar powered White LED Lighting Products to power their basic lighting requirements.  This project would reduced the kerosene subsidy up to Rs.444 million per annum.  Cabinet approval was granted to proceed with the project and also seek donor funding for the purpose.",
