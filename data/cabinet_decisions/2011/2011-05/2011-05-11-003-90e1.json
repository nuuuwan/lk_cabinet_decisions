  "decision_details": "- in addition to the water supply scheme maintained by the Jaffna Municipal Council, there are 23 small scale Water Supply Schemes operated by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board and local authorities in the Jaffna Peninsula.  With the dawn of peace in the area and life returning to normalcy, economic activities have commenced and the demand for water in these areas has increased rapidly.  With the view to meet this situation, on a proposal made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, Cabinet approval was granted for the implementation of the Jaffna, Kolinochchi water supply and sanitation project.  This project is to be implemented with foreign funds to be provided by the Asian Development Bank and other donor agencies amounting to US $138 million and domestic funding in a sum of US $26.04 million.  About 300,000 people living in the Jaffna Peninsula and the Kilinochchi District will be benefited by the implementation of this Project.",
