With the implementation of this water supply project, the supply could be extended to 12 Grama Niladhari Divisions in Kuruvita, 26 Grama Niladhari Divisions in Ratnapura and 10 Divisions in Pelmudulla.  On a proposal made by Hon. Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, Cabinet approval was granted for an addendum to the contract already awarded, to include the new water treatment plant site and supply of distribution pipes across Kalu Ganga.",
