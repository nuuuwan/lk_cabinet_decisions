  "decision_details": "- the Northern Province  consists of 5 Districts namely, Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu.  The majority of the population is Sri Lankan Tamils and this population was heavily affected by terrorist activities which prevailed for a period of nearly 30 years and as a result most of the health institutions in the Districts were damaged.  Since the commencement of the re-settlement process in the Northern Province, many development activities in healthcare institutions have been carried out with donor assistance.  On  a proposal made by the Minister of Health, Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, for the improvement of facilities and renovation work in hospitals in these Districts, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has pledged its assistance in a sum of Rs.150 million, for the following: \r\n\t* Construction of Regional Training Centre, Jaffna    - cost  Rs.50.0 million. \r\n\t* Provision of Medical Equipment to the Intensive Care Unit at District General Hospital,Kilinochchi - cost Rs.25.0 million. \r\n\t* Construction of Nursing Quarters at District General Hospital, Kilinochchi - cost Rs.45.0 million. \r\n\t* Construction of Blood Bank at District General Hospital, Vavuniya - cost Rs.30.0 million.",
