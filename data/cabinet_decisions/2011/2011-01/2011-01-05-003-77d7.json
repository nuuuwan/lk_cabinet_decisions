Arumugan Thondaman in keeping with the Budget Proposals for 2011, Cabinet approval was granted to increase the minimum purchase price of fresh milk at farm gate to Rs.50/- per ltr. to promote milk production.  The country has reached 35% self-reliance in local milk production and it is envisaged to become self sufficient in 2016, thereby saving a considerable amount of foreign exchange spent for the importation of milk powder.",
