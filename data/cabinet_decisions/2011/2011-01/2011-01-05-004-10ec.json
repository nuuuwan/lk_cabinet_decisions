  "decision_details": "- the Government has observed that a well planned programme is essential to increase the number of high yielding cattle population to upgrade the country's milk production level.  The country needs to have additional 100,000 high yielding cows to be reared under intensive farming, for it to increase milk production and achieve self sufficiency.  The Import Duty and VAT have already been removed on importation of dairy animals for breeding purposes and also for dairy equipment.  Cabinet approval was granted for the removal of the Port and Airport Development Tax (5%) and Nation Building Tax (2%) on such imports.",
