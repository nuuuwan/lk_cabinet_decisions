  "decision_details": "- a large quantity of blood is required daily for hospitals throughout the country depending on the requirements of patients.  The Blood Bank receives around 1370 pints of blood per day from the donors through its 82 branches located throughout the Island with the National Blood Transfusion Centre at Narahenpita as its Coordinating Centre.  Almost the same quantity of blood is issued to patients daily.  With the view to streamlining the process, on a proposal made by the Minister of Health, Hon. Maithripala Sirisena, Cabinet approval was granted to implement a planned programme for blood donation commencing in 2011 to get the participation of all Government Institutions and Statutory Bodies in this campaign.",
