  "decision_details": "- Vein Quartz or Silica Quartz, as known commercially, is a mineral commodity found in Sri Lanka.  Limited quantities of high purity (more than 97%) Vein Quartz Deposits are scattered in various parts of the country.  This mineral is being used in high-tech industries such as manufacturing of crystal tableware, laboratory glassware and high-end camera lenses etc. Cabinet approval was granted in principle for the proposal made by the Minister of Environment Hon. Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, for the development of Vein Quartz Deposit in Mahagama, as it would encourage foreign investment and provide employment opportunities domestically for nearly 600 persons.  A detailed project proposal for the purpose will be submitted by the Ministry of Environment to the General Treasury for evaluation.",
