  "decision_details": "- the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM) is a self financing institute providing education, training and consultancy services for the public and private sectors in Sri Lanka.  At present it admits around 3000 students per intake and trains more than 10,000 students annually.  This institute has been granted Degree Awarding Status by the University Grants Commission in 2009. On a proposal made by the Minister of Youth Affairs and Skills Development, Hon. Dullas Alahapperuma, Cabinet approval was granted in principle for the establishment of a Business School affiliated to NIBM in the name of National School of Business Management.  A 50 acre block of land in Pitipana, Homagama owned by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) has been identified to set up this National School.  Detail proposals on this project will be submitted by the Ministry of Higher Education to the General Treasury for evaluation in the first instance.",
