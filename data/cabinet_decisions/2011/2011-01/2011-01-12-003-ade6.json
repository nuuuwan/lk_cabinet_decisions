  "decision_details": "- Neelagiri Maha Seya is situated in the Lahugala forest reserve in the Ampara District in the Eastern Province.  It has been identified as the largest Stupa in the East.  Even though this place is of immense religious and archaeological importance, no development activities have taken place for the last 30 years due to terrorist activities which prevailed in the area.  Since the area has now been cleared of external threats, on a proposal made by the Minister of National Heritage, Hon. (Dr.) Jagath Balasuriya, Cabinet approval was granted in principle for the rehabilitation work in the area and to open Neelagiri Maha Seya to the general public as an archeological site in the near future.  Initial expenditure for rehabilitation work will be met from the financial provision allocated to the Department of Archeology for the year 2011 and the balance will be provided by the Government through the Medium Term Budgetary Framework 2012 - 2014.",
