  "decision_details": "- The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) conducts the listing of Census Units such as, housing units, collective living quarters and non-housing units island-wide based on the census of population and housing. The List is taken  as the Sampling Frame, in respect of all surveys conducted by the Department. From the year 2012 in which the last census of population and housing was conducted, the Sampling Frame has been considerably changed up to now due to the reasons such as disasters which took place during the period and the new settlements. Since these data are used for disaster management and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in addition to duly carrying out the surveys of population and housing, it is essential to have updated information.\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposals made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to conduct the listing of Census Units in the year 2018 covering the entire island and  subsequently, at two year intervals, thereafter, with the collaboration of the district and divisional administrative mechanisms as well, was approved by the Cabinet.",
