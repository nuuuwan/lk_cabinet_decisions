With a view to further expanding the opportunities for learning the technology subjects, it has been planned to introduce the technology subject stream in 1,500 schools by the year 2019. Since this stream is inclined towards practical activities the schools where this stream is to be taught should essentially be equipped with modern technology and training of teachers for teaching the subjects should essentially be done. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to implement the Technical Education Development Programme with the assistance of the OPEC Funds for International Development (OFID) to achieve the said objectives, was approved by the Cabinet",
