  "decision_details": "- The traffic congestion in the Kaduwela-Colombo road has become intense due to the rapid development taking place in the Battaramulla area and as a solution to the problem, it has been identified as necessary to construct a by pass road from the Polduwa Junction to Koswatta Junction circumventing the Battaramulla town.  The construction activities of the access road from the Polduwa Junction to 'Suhurupaya' has already been completed and the Cabinet approval has also been granted to extend this road up to  Udumulla Junction as a 2 lane road.\n\tConsidering the increasing traffic congestion in the Battaramulla area, it is proposed to extend this road up to the Koswatta junction. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to develop the Polduwa by-pass road about 4 km in length as a 4 lane road up to the Koswatta junction, was approved by the Cabinet.",
