  "decision_details": "Presently, the transplantation of the organs of the persons diagnosed for brain death is a surgical operation conducted globally, for a period of time. The organs of the brain dead persons connected to a ventilator in an intensive care unit can be so transplanted. There is the possibility of transplanting specially, the kidneys, heart, liver, lungs, pancreas, parts of the digestive system as well as parts of the eye, skin, veins, heart valves, ligaments and bones.\n\n\tApproximately,  750 - 1,000 are buried without retrieving organs as a result of not having an opportunity to give their consent for donating organs before their death. It is the responsibility of the Government to provide for opportunities for the people willing to donate their organs after death. Australia, France and Lebanon carry out this activity using their national data network and the countries like the United Kingdom have provided several opportunities of registration of their data network for the donation of organs through the internet, telephones, short messages etc.\n\n\tMotor traffic accidents has become a major cause for brain death and it is estimated that, approximately, more than 2,500 people die of road traffic accidents every year. Accordingly,  the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to design and implement a national programme for within Sri Lanka transplanting organs after death and to prepare an organ donor registration data network inclusive of future course of action, was approved by the Cabinet",
