However, taking into consideration the necessity of having a separate entity to achieve the objectives and carry out the  functions in a more effective manner, which were expected to be performed by the Sri Lanka National Book Development Board, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to re establish the Sri Lanka National Book Development Board which was abolished in the year 2012, was approved by the Cabinet",
