  "decision_details": "The population in the Kandy district is around 1.4 million and out of which about 150,000 are the residents of the Kandy Metropolitan Region. Daily inflow of vehicles to the KMR is about 55,000 and the 3 access roads available are not at all sufficient for the fulfillment of the present and the future  transport requirements and the roads cannot be further widened due to extensive urbanization. Due to this reason, a proposal has been made to implement a Kandy Suburban Railway Development Project to minimize the acute traffic congestion prevalent in Kandy and the Asian Development Bank has expressed its willingness to provide loan assistance for the purpose.  Accordingly, the information submitted to the Cabinet by Hon.
