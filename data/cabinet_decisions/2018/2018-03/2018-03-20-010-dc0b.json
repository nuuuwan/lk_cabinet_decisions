  "decision_details": "- The management of solid waste disposal in the urban areas has become a challenging issue due to the absence of a proper solid waste management and disposal system with necessary equipment and technology. Therefore, it has been planned to provide 190 garbage collecting compactors to the local authorities with the objective of improving the capacity of garbage collection and transportation of 84 local authorities. \n\n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to enter into the relevant loan Agreements to obtain a loan of not exceeding US$ 14 million from the Economic Development Corporation Fund of the Export - Import (EXIM) Bank  of Korea,  to cover the expenditure incurred in this regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
