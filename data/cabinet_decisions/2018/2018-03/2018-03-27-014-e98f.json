  "decision_details": "The lands acquired by the Land Reform Commission in terms of the Land Reform Laws, were vested with the Janatha Estates Development Board and Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation and later they were leased out to 23 Regional Plantation Companies for a period of 53 years with effect from 1992. Monitoring activities of the ownership rights of the Government in such companies were carried out by the Plantation Management Monitoring Division of the Ministry of Plantation Industries. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Navin Dissanayake, the Minister of  Plantation Industries, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation for the establishment of a Plantation Regulatory and Compliance Agency with sufficient monitoring powers to safeguard the interests of the Government for the remainder of the lease period of 28 years in place of the existing Plantation Management Monitoring Division, was approved by the Cabinet",
