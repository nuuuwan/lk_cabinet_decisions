  "decision_details": "- Even though there are no statistics available pertaining to the domestic workers employed in Sri Lanka, it is clear that a large group of such workers are so employed. Since the prevailing labour laws are insufficient for the protection of the rights of such domestic workers, it is found that the worker community is faced with disadvantageous situations like employment for lower salaries, inability to obtain  leave and the non availability of social security. Since the domestic workers are excluded from the application of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Employees' Provident Fund Act and the other Labour Acts, the Department of Labour is unable to intervene to protect the rights of such workers.\n\n\tThrough the \u201cNational Action Plan for Human Rights of 2017 - 2021\u201d the need for the protection of the rights of the domestic workers has also been identified.  As such, considering a proposal made by Hon. W.D.J. Seneviratne, the Minister of Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamu Development, the Cabinet granted approval in principle for enacting legislation required to protect the rights of the domestic workers.",
