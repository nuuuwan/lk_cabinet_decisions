  "decision_details": "The total installed capacity, of the the Ceylon Electricity Board currently, is 4086 Megawatts. The hydro power plants that have been generating 1,391 Megawatts of power have been limited due to the drought experienced during the last two years. Since the power plants constructed presently, are due to be completed during the period between 2019 and 2022, the need has arisen to make a temporary programme to get electricity until the year 2020.  Accordingly, considering the recommendation of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC), the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to extend the power purchase Agreements entered into in 2018 and due to expire in the near future to be extended to enable to purchase electricity further from the power plants belonging to ACE Power from Matara, Embilipitiya and Sapugaskanda for a further period of three (03) years, was approved by the Cabinet.",
