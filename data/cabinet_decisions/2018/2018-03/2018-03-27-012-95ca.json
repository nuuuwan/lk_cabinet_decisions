  "decision_details": "Action is being taken by the Government to implement a project on Light Rail Transit System (LRT) to establish an efficient and effective passenger transport system in the Colombo Megapolis area. Under this 7 LRT lines have been planned to be constructed and in this respect priority has been given to the LRT line running within Colombo and the LRT line extending towards Malabe from Boralle via Battaramulla. It is expected to commence the operation of the Colombo Light Rail (CLR) system by the year 2025.\n\n\tIn accordance with the agreement with the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) which provides funds for the construction of the proposed 2 roads the regulatory frame work relating to the above has to be drawn up before commencing the construction of the said 2 roads.
