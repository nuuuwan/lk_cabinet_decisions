  "decision_details": "- A quantity between 8,000 MT to 15,000 MT of Bristle Fiber, which is a coconut related product, is exported annually from our country to around 20 countries and a considerable amount of foreign exchange is received by such export process. Even though, there is a possibility of deriving more foreign exchange by exporting bristle fiber brushes and brooms as Value Added products, the process has been interrupted due to the difficulties in obtaining bristle fiber locally.  \n\n\tAs such, the proposal made by Hon. Navin Dissanayake, the Minister of Plantation Industries, to permit the importation of Bristle fiber from India for value addition and exportation, subject to strict plant quarantine rules and regulations, the recommendations of the Coconut Research Institute and the relevant conditions, until the local coconut harvest becomes stable, was approved by the Cabinet.",
