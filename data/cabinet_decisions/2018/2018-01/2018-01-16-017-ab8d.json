  "decision_details": "- Most of the buildings where the Courts are housed in Sri Lanka are very old and, therefore, a large amount of money has to be spent for their maintenance.  Since the legal proceedings are ever increasing the space available in the buildings are also inadequate. Further, the Court Complexes in Welimada and Ratnapura which are situated in landslide risk prone areas are required to be relocated.   \nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorala, the Minister of Justice, to construct new buildings for the Court Complexes situated in the areas of Welimada, Ratnapura, Theldeniya, Pugoda, Kantale and Kilinochchi by utilizing the financial provisions set apart from the budget for the year 2018, was approved by the Cabinet.",
