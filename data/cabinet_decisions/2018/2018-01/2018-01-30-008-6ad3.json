  "decision_details": "-\tWith the increase of the per capita income of the country during the past decade, the annual import of vehicles have also increased gradually. The information related to the tabulated increase in several types of vehicles registered in the Department of Motor Traffic during the period from the year 2008 up to the month of October in 2017 is given below. \n\n\n Class of Vehicle \n2008\n by October 2017\n\n\n Motor cars \n381,448\n749,797\n\n\n Three wheelers \n406,531\n1,135,765\n\n\n Motor cycles \n1,760,600\n3,990,505\n\n\n Buses \n81,050\n106,804\n\n\nConsequent to the annual increase of the number of registered motor vehicles, the number of vehicle files in the Department of Motor Traffic also have been increased.  A four storey building is being constructed presently, for storing these files, but the maximum number of documents that can also be stored in the record room under construction is estimated to be around 3.5 million. \n\n\tAs such, a proposal has been made to provide accommodation to store new files by the formal disposal of all files pertaining to the vehicles presently not in use. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to dispose of the files of vehicles systematically, for which no revenue licenses have been obtained continuously during the last five years, treating them as vehicles not in use, under the supervision of a group of officials of the Department of Motor Traffic, was approved by the Cabinet.  It was also decided that the files relevant to vehicles where the legal proceedings have not been completed as yet, should not be disposed under this programme.",
