  "decision_details": "- The  Medirigiriya Water Supply Scheme is implemented with the objective of providing safe drinking water to the people in the Medirigiriya Divisional Secretariat division, which has  been identified as an area which lacks safe drinking water resources and where the chronic kidney disease prevails. Owing to the resettlement of families in the same area, displaced due to the Moragahakanda reservoir project, the demand for safe drinking water is increasing and the Phase III of the Medirigiriya Water Supply Scheme has been decided to be implemented so as to supply water to cover  the demand. \nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, to award the Design and Build contract for the distribution system under Phase III of the said project to M/s Squire Mech Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd., for a sum of Rs.1,230 million, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee, was approved by the Cabinet.",
