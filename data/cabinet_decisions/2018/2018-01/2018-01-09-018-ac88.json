  "decision_details": "- The annual coal requirement for the electricity generation of the Lakvijaya Power Station is around 2.4 million MT. Dust generates while transporting the coal unloaded from the ships to the jetty and also during the storage of burned coal ash.  It poses much inconvenience to the residence living close to the vicinity.  Although, a wind barrier of the length of 450m and height of 15m has already been constructed in the coastal limits of the coal storage yard, it has been found that it is insufficient to cover the entire area during the periods of stormy winds.  It has also been found the necessity of expanding this wind barrier to cover the ash yard as well.  \n\n\n\nAs such, bids have been called for, to select a contractor to expand the existing wind barrier of the Lakvijaya Power Station around both the Coal Yard and the Ash Yard so as to cover the yards completely. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to award the contract to Laugfs Engineering (Pvt.) Ltd. and Sanken Construction (Pvt.) Ltd., for a sum of Rs.723.7 million, as recommended by the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), was approved by the Cabinet.",
