  "decision_details": "- In view of the Cabinet reshuffles which took place on several occasions in the year 2018, the number of Ministries has now been reduced up to 43. The necessity has arisen to amend the Appropriation Act passed in Parliament, last December for the year 2018 by distributing the provisions therein among the new Ministries to comply with the scope of such Ministries. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mangala Samaraweera, the Minister of Finance and Mass Media, to amend the Appropriation Act without making any changes in the total expenditure and the maximum borrowing limits imposed by the said Act, was approved by the Cabinet.",
