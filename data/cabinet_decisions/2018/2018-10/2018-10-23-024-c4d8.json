  "decision_details": "- The water collected in the Mahawilachchiya Reservoir situated adjacent to the Wilpattu National Park is the only available source of water for drinking as well as agricultural purposes of the people of the area.  As the water collected in the said reservoir is not adequate for the needs of the people, the restoration of the Kudawilachchiya tank which is a large abandoned tank situated in the Wilpattu National Park has been proposed. Also as the rural tanks situated close to the Palagala area experience shortages of water frequently, it has been identified that a project could be implemented by the restoration of the abandoned Dematagala Tank with a feeder canal to supply additional water to the rural tanks by constructing an anicut across the Heven Ella Oya, as a remedial measure. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources & Disaster Management, for the restoration of the Kudawilachchiya tank and the Dematagala tank, was approved by the Cabinet.",
