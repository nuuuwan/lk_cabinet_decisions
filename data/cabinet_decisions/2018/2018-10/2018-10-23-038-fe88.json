  "decision_details": "- Due to the scarcity of river sand utilized for constructions, there is a higher demand for the offshore sand as an alternative. As a solution to this, the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation prepares and supplies offshore sand enabling to be used for construction activities. This satisfies about 10% of the total sand requirement in the construction industry. In order to address the higher demand arising for sand in future along with the growth of the construction industry, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to purchase a Dredger for excavation of sand in the deep sea, was approved by the Cabinet.",
