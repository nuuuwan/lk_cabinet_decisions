  "decision_details": "- The construction activities of the Matara-Beliatta Railway Project are nearing completion and it is expected to implement the railway operations from Colombo to Beliatta from the year 2019 covering the entire coastal line. Since the houses of the people living in the area are on one side of the Matara-Beliatta railway line, it has been found necessary to construct roads parallel to the said railway line in order to provide access to those houses. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, to have the construction activities of 54 roads of 12.95 km in total length carried out under the supervision of the Road Development Authority (RDA), was approved by the Cabinet.",
