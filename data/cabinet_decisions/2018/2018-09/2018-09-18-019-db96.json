  "decision_details": "- It has been found that the  Stand - by Generator of Government Institutions used in emergency situations can generate about 200 MW of power. Accordingly, it has been observed that, it would be a profitable alternative, if  the above Stand-by generators could be used to feed the National Grid, rather than generating power through diesel power plants. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to grant permission to the Ceylon Electricity Board to purchase electricity generated from the Stand-by generators of Government Institutions, was approved by the Cabinet.",
