  "decision_details": "- Although the projects on construction of the Hambantota and the Nuwara Eliya District General hospitals and the supply of the necessary equipment for those hospitals have commenced from the year 2012 under the financial assistance of  Netherlands, the inability to complete the projects up to date due to various reasons has resulted in escalating the expenditure to be incurred in respect of the required equipment for the hospitals considerably. However, considering the necessity of fulfilling the requirements of the residents of the area expeditiously, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to obtain the necessary approval and secure funds to provide modern equipment according to specification,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
