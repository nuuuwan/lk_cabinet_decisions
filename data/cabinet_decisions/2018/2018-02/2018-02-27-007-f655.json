  "decision_details": "- When supplying drinking water to the Kurunegala town and its suburban areas the considerable fall of the water flow of the Deduru Oya, which is the major water source,  during the dry spells has become a major obstacle. As a solution to the problem, it has been identified that a reservoir has to be constructed upstream of the Daduru Oya basin. As such, a proposal has been made to construct Wandurapeenu Ella reservoir with a 3.6 MCM capacity and accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Rauff Hakeem, the Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, to make a feasibility study and an environmental impact assessment in this regard, was approved by the Cabinet.",
