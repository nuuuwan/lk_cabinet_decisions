  "decision_details": "- The Government has planned to construct 4,000 bridges with the objective of increasing access to markets, education and health facilities through the building of transport connectivity for the people living in the far away remote villages.  It has been identified that the Direct Lending Facility of the United Kingdom is a favourable source of loan to secure funds for this project.  \n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon.
