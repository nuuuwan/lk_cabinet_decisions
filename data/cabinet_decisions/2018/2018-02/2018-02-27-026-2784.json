Sri Lanka has already focused her attention to this problem and has taken action to establish the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team - Sri Lanka CERT/CC, as the national centre which takes action in regard to cyber security. The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team established in the year 2005 is an Administrative Institute belonging to the Sri Lanka Information and Communication Technology Agency(ICTA). Acting closely with the International Computer Emergency Readiness Teams and the other institutes dealing with the cyber security, the institution performs a national level service to provide the security relevant to information and communication technology for the public institutions of Sri Lanka, law enforcement Institutions, the Justice, Defence, Banks and Financial Services Sectors and the private sector. \n\n\tThe importance of the functions and the activities of the Computer Emergency Readiness Team of Sri Lanka is visible, in view of the the demand of the public institutions and the general public is increasing with regard to the cyber security.
