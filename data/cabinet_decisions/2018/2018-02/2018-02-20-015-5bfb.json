  "decision_details": "- The responsibility of ensuring the utility infrastructure facilities required for the Colombo Port City which is presently in progress, is entrusted to the Government of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, it has been planned to lay a 900 mm diameter waste water force main from the Colombo Port City to the Madampitiya pump station to a total length of 5.50 km. Since  a limited space is available in the section that crosses the Maccalum canal (Beirra Outfall) where the proposed waste water pipelines have to be laid, it has been planned to lay a common pipe line  in place of the 02 waste water pipe lines found there.   \n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to award the piling work to M/s ELS Construction (Pvt.) Ltd., already mobilized in the same location for the Ceylon Electricity Board Micro Piling, for a sum of Rs.48 million, was approved by the Cabinet in principle.",
