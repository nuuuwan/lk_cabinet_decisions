  "decision_details": "- Presently, the construction work of Section 1 and Section 2 of the Central Expressway from Kadawatha to Kurunegala has already commenced.  Section 3 of the Expressway from Pothuhera to Galagedara is due to be constructed and by which the Kandy Town and the other towns in the Central Province will be connected to the Expressway via Galagedara Interchange.  As a result of this, it is anticipated that traffic movement in the section of the highway from Galagedara to Kandy will be increased.  As such, it is proposed to improve the road section from Katugastota to Galagedara as a 4 lane road and to construct a new 4 lane sub\u2011road in the Katugastota Town.  \n \n\nThe EXIM Bank of India has consented to provide the necessary funds for the purpose.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the then Minister of Higher Education and Highways, to appoint RITES Ltd. of India to provide consultancy services to make a Comprehensive Project Report in regard to the development of the said road activities, taking into consideration the concurrence of the present Minister Hon. Kabir Hashim, in\u2011charge of the subject, was approved by the Cabinet.",
