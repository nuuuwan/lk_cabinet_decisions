  "decision_details": "- The ancient Ayurveda system of medicine which is older than 3,000 years, performs a significant role in the medical sector in Sri Lanka operating along side the traditional system of medicine in the country and concurrently the  Siddha system of medicine as well as the Unani System of medicine also is operating in the system of Indigenous Medicine. The Ayurveda Medical Council established under the Ayurveda Act, No.31 of 1961 is presently engaged in the registration of Ayurvedic doctors serving in the Ayurveda Medical System, regulating them and dealing with their  ethical aspects. Presently, the Ayurveda Mediccal System, by now is popular among Sri Lankans as well as foreigners, and therefore, it has been found that it is appropriate to expand the functions of the Ayurveda Medical Council as suited to the current requirements. \n\nAccordingly,  the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to present a new Indigenous Medical Council Act, for the betterment of the system of Indigenous Medicine by segregating the Ayurveda Medical Council from the Ayurveda Act, No.31 of 1961 and to regulate the functions of the Ayurveda Medical Council, was approved by the Cabinet.",
