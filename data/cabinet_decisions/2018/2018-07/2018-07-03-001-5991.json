  "decision_details": "- Excessive use of pesticides and chemicals in agricultural activities has resulted in the deterioration of the quality of water in the water sources which has adversely affected for the existence of humans and animal lives. Further, information has been received to confirm the speculation that the chronic kidney disease spread presently in certain provinces of the country, is attributed to the deterioration of the quality of water used for drinking purposes. As a solution, it has been found necessary to identify the causes of water pollution by testing the quality of water in the water sources, take measures to avoid that causes and also create awareness among the students and the public on the impact it causes. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to implement the 'Folllow-up project to check the quality of internal water sources of the country' for a period of 02 years from 2019 to 2020 by the Central Environmental Authority, by incurring a sum of Rs.44.9 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
