  "decision_details": "- The Mahaweli Development Programme largely contributes to the development of the country for a period of three decades and  after the present Government was elected to power, the construction work of the massive irrigation schemes of Moragahakanda and Kalu ganga reservoirs, which were not yet completed under the Mahaweli Development Scheme and small scale reservoirs of Maha Kithula, Maha Kirula, Alikota-Ara, Handapanagala, Dayaraba, and Puhulpola and  the North Central Maha Ela, Wayamba Maha Ela and Minipe Maha Ela, as the largest ever schemes in the 21st  century are nearing completion, under an investment of Rs.200/- million. However, with the construction of Moragahakanda Power Plant, Uma Oya Underground Hydro Power Plant and Solar power plants established at the surface of reservoirs, it has also been planned to generate 1000 MW of power to the national power grid within the next two years. Further, measures are being taken to implement a massive programme which supplies irrigation and drinking water requirements to the villages through 2,400 rural tanks, by rehabilitating thousands of old Ellanga systems which had been constructed for the preservation of rain water. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as  the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to create awareness among the public on the massive investment programme, was approved by the Cabinet.",
