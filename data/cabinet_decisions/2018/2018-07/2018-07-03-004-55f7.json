Through this, an uninterrupted connectivity will be created from down South of the Island to Kandy, linking the Port, Airport  and Commercial Cities and several provinces of economic importance. Arrangements have been made to construct phase 3 of the Central Expressway, the section from Pothuhera to Galagedara 32.5 km in length under the Japanese Banks financing.
