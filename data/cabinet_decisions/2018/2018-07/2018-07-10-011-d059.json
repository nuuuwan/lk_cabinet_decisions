  "decision_details": "- The Narcotic Bureau of the Sri Lanka Police and the Divisional Police perform a yeoman service to control the rapidly spreading drug menace within the country which has engulfed the elders as well as youth community with harmful effects  with the assistance of the Special Task Force of the Sri Lanka Police and the Tri\u2011 Forces as well where necessary.  It has been found that, obtaining of the active contribution of the Tri\u2011Forces would be appropriate to control the drug menace more successfully. It has been found that, the control of drug trafficking could be made more effective by vesting the officers who engage in drug control operations with more powers. Accordingly, the joint proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, and Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the Minister of Public Administration & Management and Law & Order, to draft the Drugs Control (Special Provisions) Bill, vesting certain powers recommended by the Attorney General with the Tri\u2011Forces for a determined period of time to control drugs menace more successfully, was approved by the Cabinet.",
