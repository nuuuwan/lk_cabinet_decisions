  "decision_details": "- The Mahaoya-Aralaganwila Road 23km in length used for the transport of passengers and goods between the districts of Ampara and Polonnaruwa, is laid across a land belonging to the Department of Wildlife Conservation and subsequently it has been developed by laying bituminous carpet. Since this road has not been assigned to any Authority for its maintenance, is in a dilapidated condition and the passengers who use this road have to face severe difficulties. Taking into consideration the above and with the objective of maintaining the road in a proper manner, the proposal made by Hon. Daya Gamage, the Minister of Social Welfare and Primary Industries, to vest the land used for the Mahaoya-Aralaganwila Road with the Road Development Authority, was approved by the Cabinet.",
