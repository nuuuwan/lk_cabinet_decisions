  "decision_details": "- The Port Access Elevated Highway Project is proposed to link the Colombo - Katunayake Expressway to the Colombo Fort and the Port via the New Kelani Bridge. This project will help to minimize the traffic congestion prevailing around the port and the city and provide trade logistics as well. Under this project, it is scheduled to construct the 5.3 km Port Access Elevated Highway from New Kelani Bridge to Galle Face with a dedicated ramp to Colombo Port. Further, upgrading the existing port access road to six lanes and installing the electronic troll collection system have also been proposed. In addition, it has also been planned to relocate 49 places of the port affected due to these constructions and to establish a maritime facilitation center.\n\nThe total investment of US$ 360.2 million is expected to be made by the Government for this Project out of which US$ 300 million is to be obtained as a foreign loan from the Asian Development Bank. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to obtain said loan, was approved by the Cabinet.",
