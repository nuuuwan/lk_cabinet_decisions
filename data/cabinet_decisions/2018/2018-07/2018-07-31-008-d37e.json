  "decision_details": "- The Colombo District (Low-lying Areas) Reclamation and Development Board was established under the Act No.15 of 1968, with a view to designing plans for developing the low-lying areas of the Colombo District for such areas to be rendered suitable for building purposes and its title was amended as Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation by the amendment Act No.52 of 1982. At present, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation not only deals with the matters pertaining to the Colombo District but the entire country as well without limiting its activities to land reclamation purposes and makes a tremendous and exceptional contribution to all development activities in the country. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to amend its title as \u201cSri Lanka Land Development Corporation\u201d, was approved by the Cabinet.",
