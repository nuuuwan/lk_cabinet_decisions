  "decision_details": "- A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed between the Shipping Corporations of the two countries of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with a view to strengthening bilateral relationship in the maritime sector. Due to the limitations in the port facilities and the depth of the Port of Chittagong which is the main port in Bangladesh, the vessels belonging to  Main Line Operators (MLOs) do not call at the Port of Chittagong. Therefore, most of the export and import cargoes of Bangladesh  are feedered via the Port of Singapore, Port of Colombo and Port of Malaysia on Common Carrier Container Feeder Vessels. The proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to select a suitable partner under a joint partnership and  reap the benefits by deploying a vessel registered under the Sri Lanka flag since the priority has been given to Ceylon Shipping Corporation for Container Feeder Service  in comparison with other countries in view of the aforesaid Agreement already entered in between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, was approved by the Cabinet.",
