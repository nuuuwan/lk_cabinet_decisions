  "decision_details": "- It has been identified that, establishment of Power Plants that utilize Natural Gas as the fuel, is more appropriate to meet the increasing demand of electricity in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, approval of the Cabinet has been received to establish two Natural Gas Power Plants of each 500 MW, as a joint venture project between India and Japan.  Kerawalapitiya area has been identified as the most suitable area to construct the Natural Gas Power Plants considering the facts such as the close proximity to the Colombo City and Suburban areas, appropriate location to build to receive the important natural gas terminal, availability of cooling water as well as the availability of the open lands to build power plants. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to vest a state land in extent of 110 acres situated at Kerawalapitiya to the Ceylon Electricity Board subsequent to a proper environmental assessment, for the construction of the proposed Natural Power Plant, was approved by the Cabinet.",
