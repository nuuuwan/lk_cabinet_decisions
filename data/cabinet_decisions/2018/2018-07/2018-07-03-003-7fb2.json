  "decision_details": "- Provisions pertaining to the safety and empowerment of women have been provided in the Constitution and in many other Acts. Accordingly, programmes pertaining to the empowerment of women are being implemented by the Government jointly  in collaboration with Non-Governmental Organizations.\n\nHowever,  due to the information pertaining to the lower percentage of women in the labour market in Sri Lanka, gender based violence and domestic violence against women, circulating in the society through unofficial statistics, the need for official statistics has surfaced to understand the real life situation of women. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to conduct a National Level survey on the women's wellbeing by the Department of Census and Statistics, utilizing the donor facility of Rs.26.9 million, to be granted by the United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) and to publish its report, was approved by the Cabinet.",
