  "decision_details": "- The small and medium scale Rice millers have to encounter financial difficulties since the financial requirements for their  day to day business can not be met from the banks due to their failure to settle the loans obtained earlier. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to provide credit facilities to the small and medium scale Rice millers through the Millers Cooperative Federation who have failed to settle the previous bank loans without taking legal action against them, was approved by the Cabinet.",
