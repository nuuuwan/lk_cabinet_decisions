  "decision_details": "- Even though various programmes have been implemented by the Department of Samurdhi Development for the economic empowerment of the Samurdhi beneficiaries, it has been found that the expected result from these programmes could not be achieved due to inadequate accessibility facilities to bring their products to the market, limitations pertaining to the water supply facility required for cultivation activities, lack of places required for marketing the products and the absence of service centres to seek technical facilities and enhance the quality of products and the insufficient infrastructure facilities.\n\nAs a remedial measure, the proposal made by Hon. P. Harison, the Minister of Social Empowerment, to implement a special programme for improvement of such infrastructure facilities in rural villages situated in the Northern, Eastern and hilly areas as well as in the districts of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Moneragala and Hambantota where the poverty exists at its highest level, was approved by the Cabinet.",
