  "decision_details": "- The Anaemia condition caused by iron deficiency has been a major health issue in Sri Lanka and the fatigue and lethargy caused by anaemia reduces the performance of an individual. Even now, iron tablets are given to pregnant mothers and school children to prevent anaemia. To address the situation it has been discovered that the anaemia condition can be reduced with the addition of Iron to the commonly consumed foods.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to appoint a committee comprising of the Officials of the relevant Ministries to study and report on the implementation of a programme on the fortification of rice and wheat flour with Iron and Folic Acid and submit a report, was approved by the Cabinet.",
