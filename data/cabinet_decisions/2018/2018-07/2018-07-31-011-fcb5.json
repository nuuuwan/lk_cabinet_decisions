  "decision_details": "- The Katukurunda Training School in Kalutara is functioning as the central training school of the Special Task Force of Sri Lanka. Sliding down on a rope or string using the Abseiling Tower and mountain climbing are a part of the challenging training sessions conducted at this school. The Abseiling Tower which is being presently used is about 31 years old and since the strength of same has also been weakened, certain challenging sessions have been stopped  considering the risk of accidents involved during the training activities. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Madduma Bandara, the Minister of Public Administration & Management and Law & Order, to expeditiously construct an Abseiling Tower with modern facilities for the Katukurunda Training School, was approved by the Cabinet.",
