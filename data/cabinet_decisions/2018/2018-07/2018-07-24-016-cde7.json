  "decision_details": "- The attention has been focused on the construction work of the Ratnapura Court Complex to be carried out expeditiously due to the apparent congestion prevalent in the Courts and the dilapidated state of the buildings and the alarming risk of landslides in the area. Similarly, it has been identified that the Killinochchi Court Complex has also to be provided with adequate infrastructure facilities to expand the building. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Thalatha Atukorala, the Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms, to award the contract of the construction of both the Ratnapura and the Killinochchi Court Complexes to the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB), was approved by the Cabinet.",
