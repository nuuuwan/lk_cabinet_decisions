  "decision_details": "- Cabinet approval has been granted to implement the project for the disposal of Municipal Solid Waste collected in the Colombo City region limits to a Sanitary Landfill constructed in the Aruwakkalu Area in Puttalam. For this purpose, 04 railway engines and carrier wagons have to be procured to transport Solid Waste from the Kelaniya railway Transfer Station to the Aruwakkalu area. \n\nSecuring locomotives for this purpose through a new procurement process will take a considerable length of time. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to couple the requirement of 04 railway locomotives for the purpose, with the ongoing procurement process commenced by the Department of Sri Lanka Railways for securing railway engines for the Department, with a view to implementing the project expeditiously, was approved by the Cabinet.",
