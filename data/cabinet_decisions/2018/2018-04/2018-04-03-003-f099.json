  "decision_details": "- The existence of an elderly population of over  100 years of age, in a country is considered a benchmark which reflects a country's development in the health sector. It is identified that, presently, there are approximately 350 elders in Sri Lanka over 100 years of age. \n\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. S.B. Dissanayake, the Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, to pay a monthly allowance of Rs.5,000/- to all citizens over 100 years of age, with a view to ensuring security and welfare of their lives, was approved by the Cabinet.",
