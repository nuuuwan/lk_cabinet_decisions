  "decision_details": "-  Although the Oluvil port developed at a cost of euro 45 million, was opened in the year 2013, it has not been possible to commence its commercial operations, due to the siltation of of the harbour basin. Furthermore, the sea erosion of coastal area to the north of Oluvil Port has progressively advanced and it has adversely affected the livelihood of the fishermen in the area. The need to take action for the immediate commencement of the commercial operations of the Oluvil Port by resolving the issues concerned has been identified. The proposed solution is dredging the coastal area south to the Oluvil harbour and   sand nourishment of the coastal area north to the harbour and it has been estimated that it would incur an expenditure of US $ 15 million. \n\n        \tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Minister of Ports and Shipping, to carry out the relevant dredging activities by securing Foreign Aid and to purchase a suitable dredger for such purpose under the Government Procurement Procedure, was approved by the Cabinet.",
