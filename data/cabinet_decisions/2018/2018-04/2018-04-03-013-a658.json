  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka placed her signature to the Treaty on Non\u2011Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in the year 1970 and in terms of the binding effect of the Treaty, Sri Lanka has entered into an Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the 06th of August 1984 on application of safeguards. The main objective of this initiative is to ensure through a verification mechanism, non\u2011diversion of Nuclear material and technology from peaceful use to Nuclear weaponization.  With a view to further strengthening of the safeguard system for collecting information of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle and its supporting elements, a proposal to sign an Additional Protocol between the member states of the relevant Agreement and the International Atomic Energy Agency has been adopted in the year 1997 and by May 2017, 129 countries have singed the protocol.  \n\nDemonstrating the dedication by Sri Lanka for utilizing the Nuclear Materials and Technology only for peaceful purposes, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to take necessary action to implement the provisions in the protocol within Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet.",
