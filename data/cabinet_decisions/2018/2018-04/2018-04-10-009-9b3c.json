  "decision_details": "- The Construction Industry Development  Act No.33 of 2014 has been enacted with the objective of  providing provisions for the development of the construction industry in Sri Lanka by regulating, formalizing and standardizing the activities of the construction industry. Since it does not cover the whole spectrum of activities in the construction industry in Sri Lanka, requests have been made by all stakeholders and professionals connected to the construction industry that the Act should be amended so as to cover all sections of the industry and the stakeholders.  As such, draft amendments to the Act have been made to amend the Act after consulting all relevant stakeholders and after an intensive dialogue. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation to amend the  Construction Industry Development  Act No.33 of 2014, based on the said draft amendments, was approved by the Cabinet.",
