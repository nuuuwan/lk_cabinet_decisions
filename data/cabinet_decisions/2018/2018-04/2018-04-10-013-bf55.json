  "decision_details": "- Schools 843  in number have been established for educational purposes of the children of the plantation community. Although, a specific land area has not been fixed for these schools, the Government has agreed in principle to reserve a plot of land in extent of 2 acres for each school. However, since the estates which were in the possession of the  Government had been transferred again to the private companies on lease basis, the maximum of 2 acres of land reserved for plantation schools have to be obtained from the private companies for the development activities of the schools. \n\nAccordingly, the joint proposal made by Hon. Lakshman Kiriella, the Minister of Public Enterprise and Kandy Development, Hon. Navin Dissanayake, the Minister of  Plantation Industries and Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to acquire a maximum of 2 acres of  lands each for the 354 plantation schools situated in 7 Districts which are presently being conducted in a limited space, from the relevant companies, was approved by the Cabinet.",
