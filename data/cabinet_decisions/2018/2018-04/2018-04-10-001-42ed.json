  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted to implement a project for the construction of buildings for the identified hospitals and to provide them with medical equipment with a view to enhancing the facilities of health services in Sri Lanka. As previously planed, it has not been able to obtain loan assistance from the EXIM Bank of China. \n\nHowever, considering the need to implement this project expeditiously, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to enter into loan agreements in order to secure US$ 72.25 million which covers 85% of the total project cost from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in Hongkong and the balance sum of US $ 12.75 million which covers the remaining 15% of the cost from the People's Bank, was approved by the Cabinet.",
