  "decision_details": "The border protection and management is highly important, in order to maintain the national security and safety of the country effectively.  This has become a matter of paramount importance especially with the increase in the cross border movement of both people and goods. As such, the National Border Management Committee has been established in the year 2016 to act as the principal coordinating body within the Government for border management.\n\t\n\tThe Committee has prepared a formal Integrated Border Management (IBM) Strategy and Action Plan, identifying the responsibilities and functions of the various inter\u2011agencies engaged in boarder protection, to establish an effective border management in the country, in accordance with the international standards.  Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, to implement the Strategy and the Action Plan under the grant aid provided by the Government of Australia through the International Organization for Migration (IOM), was approved by the Cabinet.",
