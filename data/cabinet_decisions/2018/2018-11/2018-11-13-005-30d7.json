  "decision_details": "Provisions have to be made expeditiously to hold the Provincial Councils Election since the official tenure of 06 provincial councils out of 09 have been expired by now. The delimitation of electorates required to hold elections under the Mixed Member Proportionate System presently being implemented to elect members for provincial councils which was introduced by the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988 as amended by the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No.17 of 2017 has not yet been completed. As such, considering the exigency of holding the Provincial Council Election, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports, to draft legislation to hold the Provincial Council Elections under the previous proportional representative system, and to ensure 25% women candidates at the said election, was approved by the Cabinet.",
