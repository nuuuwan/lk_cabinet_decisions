  "decision_details": "A vast damage has been caused to the paddy cultivation due to the rapid spread of brown plant hopper and yellow stem borer during the Yala season of 2018 in the Polonnaruwa and Ampara districts. Accordingly, it has been estimated that damages have been caused to 34,759 acres of paddy land owned by 18,280 farmers in the Polonnaruwa district and 7,402 acres of paddy land owned by 3,676 farmers in the Ampara district. Therefore, it has been found difficult for the farmers to obtain seed paddy for the Maha season of 2018/19. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, and Hon. Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister of  Agriculture, to grant a compensation of Rs.1,500 to Rs.3,000 per acre relative to the damages caused for the farmers who were affected due to the pest damages to purchase seed paddy for the Maha season of 2018/19, was approved by the Cabinet.",
