  "decision_details": "- Dairy cattle of around 5,000 belonging to the European Breeds and their crosses have been imported from Australia and New Zealend and distributed among the dairy farms scattered all over the Island in order to enhance the dairy production in Sri Lanka.  Although, the average production potential of these cattle is 20 to 25 Liters per day due to various reasons such as poor management standards and the environmental effects, a very low milk production of about 10 to 15 Liters per day is reported. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, the Minister of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs, to implement the projects planned for the improvement of the productivity of the farms and the enhancement of their efficiency and to appoint an Experts' Committee comprising of the representatives of the Department of Animal Production and Health and the National Livestock Development Board and to study the strategies needed in this respect and make recommendations, was approved by the Cabinet.",
