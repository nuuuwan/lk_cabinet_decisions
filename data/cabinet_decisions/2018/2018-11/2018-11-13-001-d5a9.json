  "decision_details": "The Government, through out a period of 25 years from the year 1993 up to now, has been engaged in supplying school uniform material to the school children of about 45 million in order to ensure the equality of educational opportunities to the children receiving free education. It has been found that it is financially profitable to supply uniform material obtained from the local cloth manufactures, as was done earlier, relative to the 'gift voucher method' adopted in recent times. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Education & Higher Education, to provide the school children with uniform material for the year 2019, considering the saving of about Rs.50/- per meter of cloth and also the saving of the foreign exchange by obtaining cloth material from the local manufactures, was approved by the Cabinet.",
