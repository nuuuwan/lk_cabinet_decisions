  "decision_details": "- Out of the Sacred places in Sri Lanka the Madhu Church is a destination held in high esteem and it is a place for worship and honour of local, foreign Catholic devotees and as well as other devotees. \n\t\tConsidering the inadequacy of the accommodation facilities available during the festive seasons,  a proposal has been made to construct 300 housing units for the use of the tourists and the devotees who visit the Madhu Church.  The Government of India has agreed to grant a financial sponsorship of Rs.300 million for the implementation of this housing project. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. John Amaratunga, the Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Sri Lanka and India to obtain the financial aid, was approved by the Cabinet.",
