  "decision_details": "Teaching Hospital, Jaffna is a major tertiary Health Service Centre in Sri Lanka and provides the clinical training required to the undergraduates at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Jaffna. In the year 2017, 39,390 surgeries have been performed at the hospital and out of those, around 12,486 are orthopedic surgeries requiring post\u2011operative rehabilitation care. It has been identified that the infrastructure facilities and staff training at the hospital should be improved, in order to provide quality rehabilitation care services.\n\nIt has therefore been proposed to construct a three-storey rehabilitation centre at the Teaching Hospital, Jaffna, to provide it with equipment and to implement a three year training programme to enhance the skills of the relevant staff. As such, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to implement the  proposed project at a cost of Rs.605 million, was approved by the Cabinet.",
