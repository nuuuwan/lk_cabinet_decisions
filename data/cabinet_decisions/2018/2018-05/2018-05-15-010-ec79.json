  "decision_details": "- It has been proposed to establish an Emergency Air and Technical Rescue System for Sri Lanka which responds expeditiously to transport the affected persons by air to the closest hospital for treatment from the scene of the accident when a sudden accident occurs. According to the project proposal, presented by a non\u2011profit organization in Germany known as Bijorn Steiger Stiftung, it has been planned to provide the services of an emergency rescue system with 8 helicopters and 25 technical rescue vehicles during an emergency. The estimated cost of this project is Rs.190 million and the sum will be provided as a long term soft loan.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, to appoint a Project Committee and a Negotiation Committee to make a feasibility study on the proposed project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
