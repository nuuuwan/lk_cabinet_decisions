  "decision_details": "- Owing to the increase in population and the limited land space available building complexes with multi\u2011storyes are being constructed in the city of Colombo and its suburbs. In order to ensure the safety of these properties and the occupants of these buildings it has been proposed to supply fire fighting equipment and vehicles with the objective of increasing the capacity of the fire fighting unit of the Colombo Municipal Council. \n\n\tThe UniCredit Bank of Austria, A.G. has agreed to provide an interest free loan of Euro 10.5 million for securing the funds necessary for the purpose.  Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to conduct negotiations to obtain the loan and enter into the loan Agreement, was approved by the Cabinet.",
