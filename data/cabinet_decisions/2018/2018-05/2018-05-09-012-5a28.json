  "decision_details": "At present, the investors who envisage to commence their operational activities in Sri Lanka, are supposed to obtain around 14 approvals/permits provided by various Government Institutions. The lengthy period taken for the purpose results in discouraging the investors. Even though the Board of Investment (BOI) of Sri Lanka functions as the Coordinating institution, constraints have come up in making the process efficient, due to various obstacles found in the other relevant Government Institutions. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Malik Samarawickrema, the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, to establish a Single Window Investment Facilitation Task Force with proper coordination and a mechanism for follow\u2011up action and regulation as a remedial measure, was approved by the Cabinet.",
