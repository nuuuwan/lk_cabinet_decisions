  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka is unique out of the countries with tropical coral reefs which is an environmental system containing bio diversity. More than 193 species of hard corals are reported from the sea belt around Sri Lanka and it has been estimated that more than 900 species of shore fish diversity exist associated with those coral reefs. These coral reefs provide an economic contribution towards fisheries, tourism and ornamental fish industry while also providing an environmental contribution through the mitigation of sea erosion and acting as a buffer to protect the sea belt from surge water. As of now, there is an imminent danger of the destruction of coral reefs due to human activities as well as natural phenomena such as cyclones and Tsunami. \n\n\tBy obtaining the membership of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) acclaimed as an International Organization which functions with the objective of protecting the coral reef resource, focus is made to derive the further benefits of the international partnerships for the conservation of coral reefs.     Accordingly, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as  the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to obtain the membership of the ICRI,  was approved by the Cabinet.",
