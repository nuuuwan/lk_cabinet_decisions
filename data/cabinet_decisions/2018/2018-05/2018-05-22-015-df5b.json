  "decision_details": "- Considering the demand made by the Bus Associations to revise the bus fares in keeping with the increase of fuel prices from 2018\u201105\u201111, the Cabinet granted approval at its meeting held on 2018\u201105\u201115 to increase the other bus fares by 6.56% while keeping the minimum fare of Rs.10/- static. However, the Bus Associations made representations to the effect that the increase of bus fare is inadequate and the Government has also agreed that certain value fluctuations in the price mechanism on which the annual bus fare revision is based should be amended to suit the present day values. \n\n\tConsidering these factors, the Deputy Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation     and the Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media had made discussions with the Bus Associations. According to the agreement reached at the discussion, and taking into consideration the proposal made by Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, the Cabinet granted approval to increase the minimum charge of Rs.10/- up to Rs.12/- and the other bus fares by 12.5% with effect from 2018\u201105\u201122, subject to the condition that no revision of bus fares will be made during the forthcoming period of two years.",
