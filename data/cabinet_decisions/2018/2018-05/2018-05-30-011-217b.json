  "decision_details": "- Approval of the Cabinet has been granted to construct 35 rural bridges at the same rates indicated in the original contract agreements by utilizing the savings of contingencies allocated for construction of bridges in the rural areas and construction of temporary bridges with a length of 36 meters for each Province. However,  it has been proposed at the National Steering Committee Meeting, that it would be more appropriate to construct 15 additional bridges in the most essential flood affected locations instead of 09 temporary bridges at provincial level as previously proposed.\n\n\tAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Faiszer Musthapha, the Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports, to construct 15 steel bridges in the most essential flood affected locations, instead of constructing 09 temporary bridges at provincial level, was approved by the Cabinet.",
