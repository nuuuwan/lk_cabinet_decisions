  "decision_details": "- As of now, action is being taken to establish '1990 Suwaseriya' Pre-Hospital Care Ambulance Service by an Act of Parliament. Under its second Phase, it has been planned to expand the said ambulance service, presently being implemented in Western and Southern Provinces to the other Provinces in the Island as well. The Indian Government has expressed its willingness to grant a credit facility of US $15.02 million for the purpose. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to bear the relevant tax expenditure to be incurred for the second Phase of the said ambulance service by his Ministry, until the '1990 Suwaseriya Foundation' is established, was approved by the Cabinet.",
