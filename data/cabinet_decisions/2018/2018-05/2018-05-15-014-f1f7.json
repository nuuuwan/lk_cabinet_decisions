  "decision_details": "- In the present context, global focus has been diverted for alternate sources of electricity and the generation of electricity by using renewable energy has become a costly and environmentally uncongenial process. As a result, electricity generation with wind power and solar power is spreading globally. Being an Island in the Indian ocean and situated in a region where there is  wind blowing, there is ample wind power available in Sri Lanka for the generation of electricity.\n\n\tCabinet has granted approval for implementing large scale wind power plants   to develop them as Wind Power Parks and as a first step of the venture, the preliminary activities necessary have been taken, by now, for the construction of a 100MW wind park in the Mannar Island.  The funds required  for the purpose is due to be granted by the Asian Development Bank. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, to implement the construction of 100MW wind park in the Mannar Island along with the other infrastructure facilities necessary, was approved by the Cabinet.",
