  "decision_details": "- Owing to the high quality and the efficiency of the health care system, it has been possible for Sri Lanka, to achieve satisfactory standards in various health care indicators. However, a new trend has emerged in the increase of the number of deaths caused by non\u2011communicable diseases and as well as infectious diseases. The need also has arisen for the provision of health facilities for the gradual increase of the aging population.  Therefore, the strengthening of the primary Medical Care System in Sri Lanka has become an essential factor.  \n\n\tAccordingly, the Cabinet has already granted approval to implement a project for strengthening of the primary heath care system.  The International Bank for re-construction which is an institute affiliated to the World Bank has agreed to provide the US$ 200.0 million required for the purpose. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs, to enter into a financial agreement with the World Bank to obtain the loan, was approved by the Cabinet.",
