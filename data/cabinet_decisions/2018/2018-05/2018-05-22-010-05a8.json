  "decision_details": "- The National Programme initiated for the construction of 2500 new model villages by the year 2020 through the National Housing Development Authority  by the Ministry of Housing and Construction has been implemented. By now, the work of 700 model villages has commenced and out of which 60 houses have already been constructed and handed over to the beneficiaries. It has been found that, by implementing the National Programme for Kidney Disease Prevention, National Programme for Environmental Conservation, National Programmes for Food Production and Drug Prevention National Programme as well as Let's Protect Children' national programme, at the model village level, it would be possible to achieve the desired objectives effectively. \n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to appoint a National Steering Committee, to coordinate the required resources and relevant institutions to implement the intended programmes through the Model Villages Programme, and report its progress to the Cabinet, once in every 06 months, was approved by the Cabinet.",
