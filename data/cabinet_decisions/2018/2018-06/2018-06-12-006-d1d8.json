  "decision_details": "- Action is taken to ensure the entitlement of a land, a housing unit and a settlement to the low income or poverty stricken families who do not possess a plot of land to construct a house, by the model villages programme implemented under the National Housing Programme implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Construction. Accordingly, it has been possible for the beneficiaries of the 75 model villages vested with the community under this programme, to achieve considerable progress in the implementation of drug prevention, health promotion and home gardening programmes. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Sajith Premadasa, the Minister of Housing and Construction, to establish a 'Sampath Piyasa' unit introduced by the Central Environmental Authority in every Model Village to make it possible for the disposal of non degradable waste collected in the villages in an environment friendly manner, with the support of the Presidential Task Force on Environmental Conservation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
