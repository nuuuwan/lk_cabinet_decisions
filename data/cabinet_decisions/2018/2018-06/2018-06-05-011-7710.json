  "decision_details": "- The programme of providing a packet of milk to school children from Grade 1 to Grade 5 of the selected schools in the morning, covering the students in the special educational units as well, is implemented up to date, uninterruptedly from the year 2013. Under this programme, a packet of milk containing 150 ml produced by the Milco Private Limited and purchased by the Government for a market value of Rs.30/-is given over to school children. Through this programme, it is anticipated to create a viable student generation minimizing the nutritional problems of school children. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Minister of Education, to continue to conduct this programme further, even under the presently higher market price of a packet of milk, treating the importance of conducting the programme uninterruptedly, was approved by the Cabinet.",
