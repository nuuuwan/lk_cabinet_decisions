  "decision_details": "- It has been proposed to develop the adjacent region of the sacred city of Polonnaruwa as a world heritage zone under the 'Re\u2011awakening Polonnaruwa' Project. As such, it has been planned to renovate the 19th Century building  where the project office of the Central Cultural Fund in Polonnaruwa is established, as a Heritage Management Centre, Archaeological Information Centre and a sales and Exhibition Centre for local foods and industrial products, to be attractive to both local and foreign tourists while preserving its cultural identity. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, the Minister of Higher Education & Cultural Affairs, to construct a two storey market complex expeditiously, consisting of 22 small sales centres to replace the sales centres which have to be removed due to the development of the Colombo - Batticaloa main road running in front of the said building,  concurrent to the development activities, was approved by the Cabinet.",
