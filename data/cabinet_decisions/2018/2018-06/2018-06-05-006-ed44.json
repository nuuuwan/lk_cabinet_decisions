  "decision_details": "- According to the latest statistics available, around 75% of the deaths that occur in Sri Lanka annually are attributed to non-communicable diseases. Further, it has been revealed that 72.5% of the total population do not consume enough vegetables and fruits and that around 44% of the female population do not engage in sufficient physical exercises. In order to avert this situation and to lead a healthy lifestyle, a proper awareness on health is essential. Nevertheless,  health as a subject is taught in schools only from the year six and the year nine as a compulsory subject and it is not mandatory for the G.C.E. (O/L) examination.\n\t\nAccordingly, taking into consideration the proposals made by the Expertise Committee on Educational Reforms to the effect that the subject of 'Health and Physiology' should be taught in schools as a compulsory subject up to the G.C.E. (O/L) examination from the next revision of the school syllabi, to be made in the year 2023, the Cabinet granted approval to implement the proposal made by Hon. (Dr.) Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, after obtaining the recommendations of the National Education Commission which is the authority on policy decisions with regard to the revision of the school syllabi.",
