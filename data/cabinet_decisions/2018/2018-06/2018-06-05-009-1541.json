  "decision_details": "- Over two decades have elapsed, since Sri Lanka had signed the convention on the 'Rights of the Child' and the Government has taken a large number of measures to ensure the protection and security of children.  While performing the activities pertaining to the protection of children from all forms of violence, it is imperative that the officers dealing with such activities carry out their services in accordance with the principles of child rights.  As such, guidelines to be adopted in such circumstances have been prepared under the name of  'Case Management Guidelines to Prevent Children from all Forms of Violence' by the Department of Probation and Child Care Services.\n\n\n\n\nAccordingly, the proposal made by Hon. (Mrs.) Chandrani Bandara, the Minister of Women and Child Affairs, to implement these Guidelines as the National Guidelines when taking action with regard to children and to implement, direct and monitor such guidelines by the officers in charge at all administrative levels, was approved by the Cabinet.",
