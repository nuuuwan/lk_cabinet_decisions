  "decision_details": "- The Government implements around 1,300 diverse development projects through out the country annually and out of such projects, about 1/3 could be considered as large scale projects implemented utilizing an expenditure exceeding Rs.500 million. In addition to these projects, a large number of small and medium scale development activities are also implemented in the country at provincial, district, divisional and local authority levels. However, due to the absence of a formal evaluation process on the outcome of those projects, it has been difficult to assess their productivity and analyze properly the impact caused by  them and their long term effect on the lives of the community. As such, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayake, the Minister of Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development, to implement the draft National Evaluation Policy prepared with the contribution of the relevant stakeholders and experts, as a remedial measure to overcome the situation, was approved by the Cabinet.",
