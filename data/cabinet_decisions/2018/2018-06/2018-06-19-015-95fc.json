  "decision_details": "- Around 7,000 - 1,0000 applications are made by the Muslim Devotees to the Department\tof Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs per year to take part in the Hajj Pilgrimage. However, since the annual quota received by Sri Lanka to take part in the Hajj Pilgrimage is limited from 2,200 to 3,400, it is found to be an extremely difficult task to choose the pilgrims and tour operators.  Accordingly, a proposal has been made to draft an Act to regulate the activities related to the Hajj Pilgrimage. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. M.H.A Haleem, the Minister of  Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs to instruct the Legal Draftsman to draft legislation for this purpose, was approved by the Cabinet.",
