  "decision_details": "Previously, the Government had decided to increase up to a certain extent, the price of kerosene that had been provided at a relatively concessionary rate in comparison with the high prices in the world market. Accordingly, the proposals made by the Minister of Fisheries & Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs and the Minister of Finance and Mass Media, to reduce the price per litre of kerosene increased up to Rs.101/- down to Rs.70/-, considering the requests made by the small scale mechanized fishing boat owners who use kerosene for their boats and the low income families who use kerosene for lighting, were approved by the Cabinet.",
