  "decision_details": "- Sri Lanka is bound to contribute to the global effort for mitigating the emission of Greenhouse gases which has been the cause for climate changes with the ratification of the Paris Agreement by Sri Lanka in the year 2016 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for  mitigation of the emission of Greenhouse gases.  For this purpose, approval of the Cabinet has been granted to submit a series of extensive activities which may mitigate the emission of Greenhouse gases in the 05 major sectors namely  energy, transport, industry, waste and forests to be the local contribution. In order to achieve these goals so determined locally, it is required to identify the quantity of the Greenhouse gases emitted from each of the above sectors. As such, the proposal made by H.E. the President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as  the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to obtain the Grants due to Sri Lanka in order to implement the relevant project, was approved by the Cabinet.",
