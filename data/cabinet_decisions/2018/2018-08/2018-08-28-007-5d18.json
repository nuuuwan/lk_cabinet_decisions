  "decision_details": "- Through a study conducted by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) it has been confirmed that most of the accidents related to chemical substances in Sri Lanka occur on account of being unaware of those substances,  the non\u2011maintenance of the premises using such substances, the lapses on the supervision and the misuse of the technologies. Considering the requirement of preparing a formal disaster management framework as a remedial measure to address this situation, the proposal made by Hon. Duminda Dissanayake, the Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources & Disaster Management, to conduct a Systematic diagnostic assessment of the chemical disaster risks in Sri Lanka between 2019 - 2020, was approved by the Cabinet.",
