  "decision_details": "- Even though the Voluntary Service activities being prominent in the programmes implemented by the National Youth Services Council, due to the paucity in the proper appreciation for the youth in voluntary services, it has been difficult to avail the participation of the youth in the voluntary programmes any further. As such, it has been proposed to strengthen the youth social movement at the rural, divisional and district level and to train  volunteers, through the International Organizations such as United Nations Volunteers Programme, United Nations Development Programme, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Korean International Cooperation Agency, Red Cross Society.   As such, the proposal made by Hon. Sagala Ratnayake, the Minister of Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development, to appoint a Steering Committee to make policy decisions to formulate a motivating methodology with regard to awarding Gold, Silver and Bronze medals for the volunteer workers who excel in their work and for the volunteers when seeking employment and gaining entrance to universities and other higher educational institutes, was approved by the Cabinet.",
