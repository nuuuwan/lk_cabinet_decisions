  "decision_details": "- As a major step towards reducing the huge traffic congestion prevailing in the Western Province at present, it is necessary to attract the passengers using private vehicles for transportation towards public transportation services. Accordingly, the Bus Priority Lanes are functioning successfully at present enabling passengers to minimize their travel time. In order to further improve  this situation, the proposal made by Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, to grant concessionary loans for the bus owners under the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme to motivate them to deploy Air Conditioned Low-Floor Luxury and Safety buses in place of the buses used for public transportation at present, was approved by the Cabinet.",
