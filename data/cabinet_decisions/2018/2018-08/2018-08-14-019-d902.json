  "decision_details": "- The construction process of a 32 storey building named as the \u201cMehewara Piyasa\u201d for accommodating the Ministry of Labour and all other institutions functioning under its purview, under one roof with a view to rendering a more effective quality service to the clients, has now reached its final phase. Accordingly, the proposal made by Hon. Ravindra Samaraweera, the Minister of Labour & Trade Union Relations, for securing the services of a competent external institution for the maintenance activities of this building due to the scarcity of trained staff for the proper maintenance of a building of this nature, was approved by the Cabinet.",
