- The Paddy Marketing Board Act, No. 14 of 1971 provides provisions required for the establishment of a Board to carry on the business of purchasing, selling, supplying, milling, hulling and processing paddy and rice and legal provisions on incidental matters pertaining to the supply of related services. Although 54 years have passed since the enactment of the said Act in 1971, it is still in operation as an outdated Act with no amendments made to it. Since it takes a long period of time to update the provisions of the said Act so as suit the present day requirements, it has been decided to immediately amend the relevant provisions of the Act to introduce a licensing system to regulate the irregular stockpiling and storage of paddy and rice, which has been identified as an existing problem. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to take necessary action to amend the Paddy Marketing Board Act, No. 14 of 1971, was approved by the Cabinet.

- The Employees' Provident Fund, the largest superannuation fund in Sri Lanka, currently has a total of 21.5 million member accounts and around 77,000 active employers remitting contributions. The total assets of the Fund at the end of October 2024 is Rs.4.2 trillion and has achieved continuous growth in the last few years with an annual growth in its assets exceeding 9%. For the smooth functioning of the Employees' Provident Fund, the need for an Information Technology System capable of handling a large number of user accounts and large volumes of data to process a large number of transactions with maximum efficiency has been identified. Accordingly, a project has been started in the year 2021 under the Financial Sector Modernization Project of the World Bank Group to create a new Employees' Provident Fund Management System, and the design and necessary specifications of the new management system have been completed under the consultancy of PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Limited in India. The proposal made by the Hon. President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to commence the procurement process to select a System Integrator to implement the proposed project, taking into consideration the said matters, was approved by the Cabinet.

- Although the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has made multiple attempts to modernize and upgrade the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery to meet market demands in terms of both quantity and quality, they have not been successful. Although Cabinet approval has been granted to establish the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery as a State Owned Enterprise, separate from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and to explore the feasibility of and take the necessary steps for establishing a new oil refinery in the Trincomalee area in collaboration with a suitable strategic partner, no measures have been taken in this regard to date. Under the present Government's Energy Policy Framework, modernization of the existing refinery or the construction of a new refinery has been identified as a priority activity. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation has granted approval to call for Expressions of Interest to identify a suitable investment partner based on the feasibility study carried out in the year 2022. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Energy to call for Expressions of Interest to identify and select suitable financiers/investors to implement the project to develop the Sapugaskanda refinery and to establish a new refinery with the capacity of 100,000 barrels per day on Build, Operate and Transfer basis in the same site, and to call for proposals from the entities fulfilling the qualifications, was approved by the Cabinet.

- The digitization of the documents of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka, aiming to improve its efficiency, accuracy and accessibility, has been identified as an essential step towards the administration and enforcement of intellectual property in the country. It is expected that, through the introduction of online registration facilities, electronic filing and record-keeping systems, digitization of archived records and online communication platforms under such digitization programmes, more reliable, faster and user-friendly intellectual property service will be ensured. Accordingly, the operations of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka will be facilitated to be carried out more efficiently and effectively. The World Intellectual Property Organization has agreed to provide a technical and services grant worth Rs.70.2 million for the implementation of the said project. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development to implement the project to digitize the documents of the National Intellectual Property Office of Sri Lanka and to sign a Cooperation Agreement with the World Intellectual Property Organization to obtain the proposed grant, was approved by the Cabinet.

Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism to sign the said Agreement during the forthcoming official visit of the Hon.
