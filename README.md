### 6) Construction of a new residential building at the Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre for young people with drug addiction

*2025-06-09*, *#10*

*Source:* [https://www.cabinetoffice.gov.lk/cab/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=49&lang=en&dID=13225](https://www.cabinetoffice.gov.lk/cab/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=49&lang=en&dID=13225)

The National Dangerous Drugs Control Board conducts treatment and rehabilitation services for people with drug addiction, under residential and¬† ¬† non-residential community-based models. Under this, a dedicated treatment centre for children and young people below 21 years of age with disabilities arising from drug use disorders is being maintained at Mampitiya Watta, Handessa, Peradeniya. It has been identified that separate treatment services and adequate separate space are essential for the treatment of the relevant persons, paying attention to the psycho-social characteristics of the persons belonging to that age group and their drug use related behaviors. Since the current residential capacity of the relevant Centre is only for 35 persons, it is necessary to maintain a waiting list for admissions. Therefore, the¬† proposal made by the Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs to construct a new residential building in the premises of the Peradeniya Treatment Centre, spending Rs.110 million from the provisions allocated under the Clean Sri Lanka Programme, enabling to expand and expedite treatment opportunities for children and young people with drug addiction, was approved by the Cabinet.

### 7) Purchase of Waste Compactor Vehicles for regularizing transport of Waste in Local Authorities

*2025-06-09*, *#9*

*Source:* [https://www.cabinetoffice.gov.lk/cab/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=49&lang=en&dID=13224](https://www.cabinetoffice.gov.lk/cab/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=16&Itemid=49&lang=en&dID=13224)

Like many developing countries, solid waste management in Sri Lanka is currently facing many challenges and difficulties. Accordingly, the need to improve the infrastructure required for municipal waste management has been identified. The existing garbage compactors and tractors are used to transport the collected municipal waste in an environmental friendly manner to the treatment sites so as to minimize public impact, and 100 compactors were purchased in the year 2017 using domestic funds for the said purpose. However, it has been observed that the number of such vehicles and the number of vehicles including tractors owned by the Local Authorities are not adequate to manage the amount of waste currently generated. Accordingly, the proposal made by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Local Government to purchase 16 waste compactor vehicles to streamline the collection and transportation of waste in the selected Local Authorities, utilizing the budgetary provisions of Rs. 500 million allocated for the year 2025 under the Clean Sri Lanka Programme, was approved by the Cabinet.

### 8) Improving and maintaining the broadcasting activities of the Independent Television Network

The Independent Television Network, which was started as the first television channel in the country, operates as a company with 100% share rights owned by the General Treasury. However, due to the fact that programmes have to be produced using computer accessories and outdated software that are several years old, it has become problematic to broadcast high-quality, attractive programmes while competing in the field. Therefore, taking into account a proposal made by the Minister of Health and Mass Media, the Cabinet decided to allocate the required provisions through the 2026 Budget on a priority basis to secure several essential¬† accessories for the Independent Television Network, enabling to enhance subscriber attraction and continue telecasting activities without interruption.

Proposals have been invited through the International Competitive Bidding Procedure to select a consultancy firm to prepare the master plan for the Bandaranaike International Airport. After evaluating the said proposals,¬† Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) (Private) Limited has cancelled the relevant contract due to non-adherence to the conditions of the contract by the company that was awarded the contract and resumed the procurement process on the approval of the Cabinet.
